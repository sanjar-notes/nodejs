<details><summary>caveat</summary>
  
  I already had working experience with server-side apps in Ruby on Rails, Node.js and React.js, but it wasn't a granular study. Since I already know that, I skip stuff like JavaScript lang, AJAX, HTTP verbs, and frontend concepts. 
  *I still have links and short notes for such stuff, btw*.
