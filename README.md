<details><summary>caveat</summary>
  
  I already had working experience with server-side apps in Ruby on Rails and Node.js, but it wasn't a granular study. Since I already know that, I skip stuff like JavaScript lang stuff, HTTP verbs, and frontend concepts. 
  *I still have links for most stuff, btw*.
