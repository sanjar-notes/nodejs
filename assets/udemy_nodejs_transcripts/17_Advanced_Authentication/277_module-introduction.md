## 277. Module Introduction

<strong><em>no description</em></strong>

Now that we learned some new tricks regarding how we can send mails, let's use
that new knowledge to improve our authentication features and in general, let's
improve our security or the authentication related things in our app. 

For example let's also work on ensuring that only users who created a post can
edit it but let's start with resetting passwords. 

To be precise in this module, we'll start with resetting passwords but then
we'll have a look at authorization which is that part I just talked about with
ensuring that you can only edit and delete what you created.
