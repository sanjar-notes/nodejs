## 287. Wrap Up

<strong><em>no description</em></strong>

In this module we had a look at some advanced authentication related topics,
namely we had a look at password resetting and there it was important to
understand that you of course have to implement password resetting in a way that
prevents users from resetting random user accounts. 

Therefore we implemented such a short lived password token so that it's not
valid forever to reduce the chance of it being generated by some brute force
attack and therefore, our reset token is a great mechanism to identify the user
for whom we want to reset the password. 

The token has to be generated in a way that is random, unguessable, at least in
a reasonable amount of time hence the expiration date and unique and in this
module, we implemented a token in exactly that way. 

We also had a look at authorization and authorization is all about locking down
access for authenticated users because just because you're authenticated, you're
not allowed to do everything. 

You might be logged in in your udemy account but you can't edit my course
because you are not the creator of the course and that's the idea of
authorization and that is also what we did in this module when we ensured that
only users who created a product can actually view, edit and delete it. 

So authorization is a crucial part of most applications and together with
authentication which is the surrounding topic of having users in general, you
can really control which visitor can do what in your web app in your website.
