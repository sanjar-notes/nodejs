## 41. Module Introduction

<strong><em>no description</em></strong>

Now that we already had a pretty close look at nodejs and worked a lot with it,
let's take one step back and let's see how we can both make development a bit
easier, how we can speed that up a little bit and most importantly, how we can
actually debug our nodejs apps or how we can use various tools to understand
better what's going on in our nodejs applications. 

Because in this module, you will learn some tips and tricks which will hopefully
help you write nodejs applications in a very efficient manner.
