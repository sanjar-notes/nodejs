## 271. Module Introduction

<strong><em>no description</em></strong>

In this module, I now want to give you an introduction to how you can send
e-mails from inside your node application. 

Obviously sending emails is a crucial task in many web applications and in our
website here, we could want to send an e-mail after a user signed up for example
to confirm the sign up, something like that. 

Now for that I will show you how that works, what sending e-mails in a node
application actually means and which part nodjs and expressjs play in that big
picture and we'll then implement it. 

We'll then implement a package that helps us sending e-mails and we'll send an
e-mail upon successful sign up. 

So let's work on this in this module.
