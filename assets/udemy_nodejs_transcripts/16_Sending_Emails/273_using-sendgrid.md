## 273. Using SendGrid

<strong><em>no description</em></strong>

So in this course, I will use sendgrid you'll find it on sendgrid.com and I'll
use it because they have a free entry tier which stays free as long as you send
less than 100 e-mails a day. 

Now there are many alternatives, MailChimp, AWS, SCS and you can google for
nodemailing and your favorite mailing service to find tutorials on how to
implement it, now I will use this one because we can use it for free. 

So let's click try for free and then we simply have to create an account there. 

Now once you did sign up, you can quit that page here and go back to your node
project and there we'll now install a package. 

I'll install a package with npm install --save which is called node mailer and
to interact with sendgrid, I'll also install another package in the same go,
nodemailer-sendgrid-transport, that is a package that will help us with
integrating sendgrid and conveniently use that together with nodemailer. 

Nodemailer is a package that as the name suggests, makes sending emails from
inside nodejs a breeze. 

With that all added, we can move on to the next lecture and now start using
nodemailer to send messages. 

So let me start that server again and let's continue in the next lecture.
