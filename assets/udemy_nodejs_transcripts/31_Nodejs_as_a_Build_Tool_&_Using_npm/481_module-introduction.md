## 481. Module Introduction

<strong><em>no description</em></strong>

In this course, you obviously learned a lot about node and how to write node
code and build web servers or web applications with node because that really is
its main thing. 

But node and npm, the package manager we get for free when installing nodejs can
also be used as a build tool, so as a tool that runs utility scripts on your
computer and can help you with building, any mostly javascript driven project
and that does not have to be a web application or a server side web application
if it is one, it could be a frontend web application too like the react app we
had in this course, the frontend for the rest and the graphql API. 

And in this module we'll briefly dive into that and I'll explain why that is the
case, what exactly npm is and how we can use it and how we can use node as a
build tool.
