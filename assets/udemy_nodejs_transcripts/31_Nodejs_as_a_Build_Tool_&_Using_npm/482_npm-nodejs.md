## 482. npm & Node.js

<strong><em>no description</em></strong>

It's important to understand that when we install nodejs, we get two tools or
two things for the price of one you could say. 

We get nodejs and we get npm, node's package manager and remember that this was
the tool we used for installing packages into our project or when I share my
project, like with all the code attachments, that you could re-install all
dependencies required by that project even though I did not share the node
modules folder because we have that package.json file where we see all the
dependencies. 

So nodejs is the programming language we used to execute code, to execute
javascript code based on that nodejs runtime with all the features that gives us
and especially important when we look at it from a build tool perspective, we
have to remember that with nodejs, we were able to interact with files and this
will become important in a second. 

Npm as I said is node's package manager, so we manage guess what, packages with
it and with that, I mean we can install packages, download them, manage their
versions and so on and we can also run scripts. 

We did that with npm start for example to start our server so that we don't have
to write or type the full command for that. 

Now let's have a closer look at these two pieces and see what else they can do
or how that can be helpful to use them in the context of build tooling, so in
the context of utility scripts and not in the context of spinning up a web
server.
