## 116. Preparations

<strong><em>no description</em></strong>

Now before we dive into dynamic routes you need to adjust your project a bit,
either because you skipped the last module altogether and therefore you should
download the entire snapshot I attached to this lecture which contains my latest
state but you should also download that snapshot or the adjustments zip file
which contains the files you will need to add to your project in case you don't
want to use my snapshot but if you skip the last module, always go with that
snapshot. 

Now in the adjustments zip file and you can ignore that if you download the
snapshot, in the adjustments zip file you will find that javascript file, the
main.js file which you should move into a js folder in the public folder, you
will also find that main.css file and the product.css file in there and you
should also replace yours in the css folder with the ones you find attached
because I fine tune some styles. 

Additionally, make sure that you also replace all the views you find in that
attached zip file and you simply replace your existing files or their content
with the attached files or the content of the attached files. 

And with that added and in case you are facing any problems, simply take the
snapshot. 

With all that added, let's now start writing our dynamic route code.
