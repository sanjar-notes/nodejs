## 115. Module Introduction

<strong><em>no description</em></strong>

In the last module, we continued working on our application but now we need the
ability to pass some dynamic data through our routes. 

We want to be able to encode some information in our url so that we can for
example pass a product ID as part of the url. 

In this module, you will learn how you can do that, how you can actually submit
or send data through the url and when you would not do that and put it into the
request body instead and we'll also continue working on our models, to be
precise you will learn about how to pass route params, route parameters and how
to use query parameters, both important things that the express router supports.


But besides that we'll not just pass that information, in this module we'll also
use it to enhance our models and with that I mean will add more functionalities,
we'll even add a new model. 

So with that, let's start and let's learn how we can pass data and how we can
use that data then.
