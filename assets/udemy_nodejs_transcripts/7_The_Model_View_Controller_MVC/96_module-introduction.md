## 96. Module Introduction

<strong><em>no description</em></strong>

In this module I want to dive into a very important aspect of building web
applications, backend applications like the one we're building. 

We want to follow a certain pattern for structuring our code and with that, I
don't really just mean how we split it over files or how we write the code but I
mean how we logically separate our code and the different functions it fulfills
or the different things it does. 

We'll dive into the MVC pattern and you'll understand in this module what this
actually is and how we can add it in our project and of course we'll not just
add it to the existing project but we'll also advance our project to get closer
to that online shop we're building.
