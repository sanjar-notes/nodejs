## 539. Wrap Up

<strong><em>no description</em></strong>

<v Instructor>Now that's it for Deno or Deno for now.</v> Of course, you can
dive deeper. 

Generally, however, you can of course, build the same things with Deno as you
can with Node. 

Now, as I mentioned in the previous core section, at the end though, Deno is not
as mature as Node. 

We have all those third-party modules but of course, there isn't a module for
everything. 

For example, at the moment at least, there is no Mongoose module, which as you
saw in the Node parts of this course, makes working with MongoDB much easier. 

We don't have that here, for example. 

Also, a lot of those third-party modules but also a lot of the standard library
modules are work in progress, which means they can change over time, they can
contain bugs, and therefore, this might not really be production ready. 

You now, however, got a good and very through introduction into Deno and what
you can do with it and how you can build web applications with it. 

After all, we built a complete REST API with database access and a connected
frontend here, which certainly isn't too shabby.
