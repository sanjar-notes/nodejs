## 533. Module Introduction

<strong><em>no description</em></strong>

<v Instructor>In the previous module, we took a first look</v> at Deno, or Deno,
however you wanna pronounce it, and I showed you how it relates to Note and also
what some differences are. 

Now, in order to take you one step further and to really enable you to work with
Deno as you're able to work with Note, in this module we'll have a closer look
at Deno and we'll do a bit more with Deno. 

Specifically, in this module we're going to connect a front end to the rest API
we built in the previous module. 

For that, of course, you should make sure that you go through that last module,
of course, also to pick up the basics about Deno in general, and besides
connecting a front end, we'll also connect a database, MongoDB in this example,
so that you also see how Deno could interact with a database, so let's get
started.
