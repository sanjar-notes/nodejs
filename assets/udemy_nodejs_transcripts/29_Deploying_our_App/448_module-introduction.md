## 448. Module Introduction

<strong><em>no description</em></strong>

You did it. 

You built an amazing nodejs application and in this course, we actually build a
couple of applications and we're typically not just doing this for our own
practice or to do it on our PC only, instead we of course want to deploy this
application into the web so that it is reachable by other people because as long
as it's running on localhost, only you can reach it and that is the idea during
development of course. 

Now in this module, we'll move from development to production and you will learn
how we can prepare our project for deployment. 

There are some things we just want to adjust or where we want to make sure that
we don't skip them. 

We'll then of course also walk through all the important steps and the
configuration you need to do to deploy your project to a hosting provider and
we'll talk about security because that obviously is connected to deploying your
app because as soon as it does not run on your own computer anymore, you
obviously have to make sure that some things just are, well secure. 

So let's dive into all these things in this module.
