## 504. A First Summary

<strong><em>no description</em></strong>

<v Instructor>Now, that's it for the TypeScript Basics.</v> Of course,
TypeScript has more to offer, way more, but as I mentioned multiple times, I got
a course for that if you're interested in this. 

With these basics, you got everything you need to go through that course, and
you will also learn TypeScript along the way in this course. 

These basics are all you need here, and with that, maybe TypeScript also looks
quite interesting to you. 

In that case, I'm of course also happy to welcome you in my TypeScript course.
