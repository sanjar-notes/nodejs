## 494. Module Introduction

<strong><em>no description</em></strong>

<v Instructor>In this module,</v> I don't just have a new slide deck with new
colors, but more importantly, in this module, we're going to dive into a new way
of writing our node code. 

You'll learn how to use Node.js with TypeScript basically to write node Express
code as you learned throughout this module with extra features provided by
TypeScript. 

Now, for that in the next lecture, I'll first of all explain what exactly
TypeScript is and why you might want to use it. 

I want to say right away that using it is 100% optional, and you don't need to
use it. 

Otherwise this module would have come way earlier in the course, of course. 

What you'll learn in this course is 100% correct and 100% relevant. 

What you'll learn in this module, we'll just build up on the knowledge you gain
there and show you a slightly different way of writing your code, utilizing
TypeScript, but as you will see throughout this module, and also in the
conclusion at the end of the module, the code you write will not really differ
that much, and you will use everything you learn in this course, just with extra
features added, if you want to have a better development experience, and to
avoid unnecessary errors.
