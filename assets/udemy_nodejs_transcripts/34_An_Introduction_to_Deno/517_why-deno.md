## 517. Why Deno?

<strong><em>no description</em></strong>

<v Instructor>Now why do we have and need Deno?</v> Well, if we need it or not
is, of course, up to you and the entire community to decide. 

We have it because Ryan Dahl, the creator of Node, so the person who invented
Node 10 years ago, is also the creator of Deno. 

And he came up with Deno, because he simply wasn't happy with Node anymore. 

Now I wanna be very clear. 

Node is not going to go anywhere. 

And you don't need to take this from me, you can take it from Ryan himself. 

Node is not going anywhere. 

It's mature, it's big, it's there, it's established, it's being used by
thousands of developers and companies. 

So Node isn't going anywhere. 

But Deno can be worth a look, because it does some small things differently than
Node, simply because Ryan thought like, well there was this chance of making
Node better. 

And Deno is the result of that, you could say. 

Now, we'll come back to this question of whether you wanna progress with Deno,
Deno, whatever you wanna call it, or if you should stick to Node at the end of
the module. 

I'll come back to that there. 

The main takeaway is that there will be some core differences, which we'll see
in action throughout this module, but that, of course, you might not need all
those enhancements introduced by Deno. 

So therefore, the established, highly active ecosystem, the fact that it's
production-proved and that it's very mature, that might be strong reasons for
sticking to Node. 

Deno, of course, has some core differences, which also might be interesting, and
therefore, we'll now have a look at all of that throughout this module. 

We'll get started by installing Deno, and by writing some basic code with it,
and we'll then, by the end of the module, find out whether you should switch or
stick.
