## 149. Module Introduction

<strong><em>no description</em></strong>

In the last module, you learned how to use SQL in a nodejs application and we
did this at the example of a MySQL database which we want to use to store data. 

Now we didn't complete the project with that SQL approach simply because in this
module, we'll now implement other features like for example working with the
shopping cart with the help of sequelize. 

This will still use a SQL database, still use the same MySQL database actually
behind the scenes or in the background as a database but the code we write will
be different. 

Instead of SQL statements as we have them here and as we wrote them in the last
module, we'll use a third party package that allows us to work with javascript
objects and convenient methods to create new elements in the database, to edit
them, to delete them or to find them and also to connect them because you
remember, a SQL database typically also works with relations and we got lot of
these in our current project. 

So this is what we'll dive into in this module,  you'll learn what exactly
sequelize, this third party package is and how you can use it and we'll then
implement our products and our cart and so on in this module with sequelize.
