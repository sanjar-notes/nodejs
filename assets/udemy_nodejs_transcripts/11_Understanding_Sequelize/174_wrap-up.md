## 174. Wrap Up

<strong><em>no description</em></strong>

That's it for the SQL part of this course. 

You learned about SQL, that it's a database philosophy or schema engine type
that uses strict data schemas and relations in the databases that use SQL and
that you can easily connect to such databases with nodejs, with packages like
MySQL too. 

There we had to write all the SQL queries manually though and you also have to
configure the database manually, add tables manually, set up relations and that
is a lot of work and definitely something you need to learn in addition to
nodejs, it's its own language essentially or you use packages like sequelize. 

Sequelize allows you to not write SQL queries but instead interact with your
database through models you define and not just models but also relations,
so-called associations in the sequelize world. 

That gives you a lot of magic methods that allow you to easily connect data, add
data, delete data, basically what you saw in this module. 

Now you could easily create an entire course just about SQL and sequelize and
that is not what this course is, it's the complete node course, not the complete
sequelize course. 

I strongly encourage you to dive into the sequelize docs if you plan on
continuing with that to learn all the ins and outs of this package and simply
play around with it, build your own demo applications and try out the different
features, different types of relations and so on. 

We'll move on here and we'll learn about a different way of storing data with a
NoSQL approach in mongodb. 

This is what we'll dive into in the next modules.
