## 406. Module Introduction

<strong><em>no description</em></strong>

A lot of exciting things were covered in the last modules. 

Rest APIs, async await and we'll continue on that road, we'll dive into a very
exciting technology that you can use in node applications, web sockets. 

Web sockets are a nice way, a protocol essentially which allows us to build real
time web services. 

Now what exactly does that mean and how does that work? 

That is what we'll cover in this module. 

You'll learn why you would want to use real time web services and what that
actually is and we'll see how we add real time communication to our node app or
to any node app of course. 

We'll use a certain library for that, socket.io and I will teach you everything
you need to know about why to use that, how it works, what you can do with that
and how you use it in your project.
