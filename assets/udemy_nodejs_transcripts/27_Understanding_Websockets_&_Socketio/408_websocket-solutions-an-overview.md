## 408. Websocket Solutions - An Overview

<strong><em>no description</em></strong>

Now for adding web sockets, you've got a broad variety of methods to use. 

If you google for node web sockets or node express web sockets, you'll find a
lot of articles and packages you can use. 

One of the most popular packages however is socket.io. 

Socket.io is a package that uses web sockets and gives you a lot of convenience
features around that protocol that make it very easy to set up a web socket
channel but with a client in the server and to use that channel. 

You can learn all about it here in the official docs, this is no socket.io
course so we'll not cover every single feature it offers but I will show you how
to add it to a project and how to set up some basic communication. 

So socket.io is what we'll use and socket.io and that is the key thing I want
you to understand does use the web socket technology, the web socket protocol
and sets it up behind the scenes for you. 

You don't have to use socket.io to use web sockets though, you could use one of
the other options I showed you on Google before. 

There are packages that give you a more raw approach with less convenience
features and that might be what you're looking for for specific operations. 

We'll go with the convenient solution of socket.io here though and I strongly
recommend diving into some advanced resources if you want to learn all about web
sockets or socket.io specifically. 

So how can we add it to our project now?
