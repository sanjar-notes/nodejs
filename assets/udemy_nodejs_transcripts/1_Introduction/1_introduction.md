## 1. Introduction

<strong><em><p>Welcome to this Node.js course!&nbsp;Let me introduce myself and give you a rough overview of this course and what it's all about!</p></em></strong>

Welcome onboard of this course, I'm extremely excited to have you as a student
in this course. 

This course is all about nodejs, one of the most exciting server side
technologies you can learn these days. 

And in this course, we'll not just dive into its basics, though we will also do
that but we'll dive into exciting topics like handling file uploads, pagination,
working with different databases, SQL and NoSQL databases for example, building
an app where we render views, dynamic html on the server and building restful
and even graphQL APIs, working with real time data and web sockets and much much
more as you will see in the outline which will come later in this module. 

There is a lot of content in this course and it definitely is no short course
but it will take you from zero to advanced nodejs developer and by the end of
this course, you will have all the knowledge you need to dive deeper into
advanced topics and start building your own. 

nodejs projects and applications of course. 

And we'll not just learn all of that in theory, we will build real projects in
this course. 

We will build an entire online shop including checkout and payment with
stripejs, so there's a lot of content to cover and I'm really excited to dive
into it together with you. 

Now who am I? 

My name is Maximillian Schwarzmuller and I'm a freelance web developer as well
as five star rated instructors here on Udemy. 

I've got multiple best-selling courses and nodejs is a topic that was missing
thus far, well it isn't anymore and I had a lot of fun creating this course, I
hope you have equally much fun and you'll learn a lot whilst going through the
course. 

So let's dive in and let's start with the most important question, what is
nodejs?
