## 338. Module Introduction

<strong><em>no description</em></strong>

I'm really happy with the shape our course application is taking and we're
diving into many exciting features we can build with node and express as you
see. 

Now that we're able to work with files and even generate them on the fly on the
server, let's dive back into some work with our database or interactions with
our database. 

There right now we always fetch all products when we display the product page. 

In this module, we'll dive into a technique called pagination which allows us to
split our data across multiple pages, something you typically want to do when
you work with a lot of data. 

So let me show you how this can be implemented with our application in this
module.
