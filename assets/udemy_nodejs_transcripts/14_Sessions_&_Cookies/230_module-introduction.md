## 230. Module Introduction

<strong><em>no description</em></strong>

Enough about databases for now but let's stick to storing data and let me dive
into some mechanisms of storing data in memory or even on the client side, so in
the browser. 

And for that in this module, we'll have a look at the sessions and cookies, two
important constructs or technologies in web development in general which you can
of course also use in nodejs. 

Now in this module, we'll have a look at what exactly cookies are and of course
what exactly sessions are and then how you can use both and how you typically
use them together. 

So let's dive in and let's understand what these things are and how we can add
them to our project and why we would add them.
