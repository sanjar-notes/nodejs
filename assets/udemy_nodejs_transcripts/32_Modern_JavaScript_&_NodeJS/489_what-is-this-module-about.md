## 489. What is this Module About?

<v Instructor>I wanna start with ES Modules.</v> What are ES Modules? 

Well, in the end, it's a concept coming from the browser side JavaScript code. 

There we can also import and export files. 

And it's relatively new that we can do that there. 

Six years ago, that wasn't really a thing in the browser side. 

But now, we can import and export there, and in modern JavaScript in the
browser, the import/export syntax does not look like the syntax we use in Node
JS. 

Instead, in the browser, we export something from one file to another file, with
this syntax, and we then import it in that other file with this syntax. 

Now there are various variations of this import/export syntax, and in my
"JavaScript, the Complete Guide" course, you can learn all about that. 

It's all about JavaScript, and it therefore covers all JavaScript features,
including this ES module import/export syntax in all different variations you
can learn it. 

In addition, if you Google for Node ES modules, you will also find the official
Node.js documentation for ES modules, and there you can also learn all about it,
though I will show you the core essentials, and walk through those together with
you in this module. 

Just want to point you at those extra resources, which can also be interesting. 

With that, however, let's now dive in and let's see how we can utilize this
syntax in our Node projects to switch away from that require and module exports
syntax, which we use throughout the entire course, though not without saying one
important thing first. 

The syntax you'll learn in this course and this way of importing and exporting
with const, require, module exports, what we did in this course is the de facto
standard for Node projects. 

Switching to this newer syntax, which I'm about to show you in this module, is
optional, and you can do it, but the vast majority of projects, as I mentioned
already, will use that other syntax. 

So this is really just an option here, not mandatory.
