## 488. Module Introduction

<strong><em>no description</em></strong>

<v Instructor>In this bonus module,</v> we're going to dive into Modern NodeJS
Core. 

And I put the Modern between quotes here, because you shouldn't take it too
literally. 

What you learn in this course is 100% correct, 100% up to date, and used in the
vast majority of projects. 

Now, obviously, I didn't count all projects, but if you look out there in the
wild, in open source projects, if you explore other tutorials, if you explore
any Node code basis you can find, you will see exactly the kind of code in
there, which we wrote throughout this course. 

Nonetheless, it is important to realize that over the years of Core's NodeJS and
JavaScript itself, evolved. 

JavaScript now is not the same as JavaScript nine or 10 years ago, But that was
when NodeJS was created initially. 

Therefore NodeJS was created at a time where in JavaScript, we simply didn't
have the same amount of features available as we do now. 

And therefore, naturally NodeJs is missing some features. 

r at least the main NodeJs code you write does not use all those latest
features. 

But that does not mean that you can't use them in general. 

NodeJS supports modern JavaScript syntax features. 

And in this Module, I'll have a look at two features which landed in NodeJS
which you can use now, which might be interesting to you. 

And that will be ES Modules, simply a different way of importing and exporting
files as you will see and Promises. 

Now, especially for Promises, this might be surprising because we already worked
with Promises and Async/Await throughout the course. 

But I'm talking about Promise support in Core Node APIs, like the file system
APIs Node ships with, those are traditionally callback based. 

And therefore, as you'll learn in this course, they can suffer from certain
problems. 

And you might wanna use Promises for those and it turns out that you can. 

So let's have a look at all of that step by step throughout this Module.
