## 24. Module Introduction

<strong><em>no description</em></strong>

So let's dive into nodejs now and what better way to start with it then of
course from scratch with its basics. 

In this module, you will learn how the web actually works. 

This will only be a brief refresher but since we will of course use nodejs in
this course to build a server, a web application and write server side code, we
obviously have to make sure we all understand how the web works and which role
nodejs plays in that bigger picture. 

Now this will only be a brief refresher, obviously we'll then dive into creating
such a nodejs server and running nodejs code when requests are reaching that
server and of course, we'll also send back responses. 

For this we'll also use node core modules, like the file system module you saw
in the first course section. 

We'll use another very important core module in this section which is related to
creating such a web server. 

Now as I already mentioned, an important part of creating a web server is of
course that we're able to handle requests and responses so that you learned how
you can use nodejs and the many features that offers to accept incoming requests
and do something with them, for example parse them and how to send back
responses, these are crucial things you've got to know. 

Now related to all of that, we'll learn how nodejs uses asynchronous code and a
concept called the event loop to stay reactive and ensure that our script never
slows down and always works just fine. 

So with that, let's dive into nodejs.
