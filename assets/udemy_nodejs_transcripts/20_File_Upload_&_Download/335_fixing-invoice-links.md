## 335. Fixing Invoice Links

<strong><em>no description</em></strong>

Now one last adjustment I want to make is that I want to go into my views real
quick and fix the placement of my invoice link in the orders.ejs file. 

There I have that invoice link next to every product and that is incorrect of
course, it should be next to the order so next to the order ID, I will have my
invoice link so that now if I reload that orders page, I have that link up there
which makes more sense logically but the behavior of course didn't change.
