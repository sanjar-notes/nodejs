## 319. Module Introduction

<strong><em>no description</em></strong>

Now that we know how to work with errors and now that we learned a lot about
node express in general, let me dive into a little more advanced or specialized
topic, file uploads and downloads. 

Now it's actually not something that rare, you'll often have a feature like this
on your web page and therefore it is important to understand how you can allow
your users to upload files and how you can handle that on your server side and
which different possibilities you have for returning files to your users. 

So this is essentially what we'll dive into in this module. 

We'll have a look at how to upload files and most importantly how to handle them
on the server and of course we'll then have a look at the different options you
have for returning files. 

So let's dive in.
