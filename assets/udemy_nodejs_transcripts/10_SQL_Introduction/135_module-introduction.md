## 135. Module Introduction

<strong><em>no description</em></strong>

It's now finally time that we start storing our data in a more correct or
realistic way because thus far, we either used the memory when we just stored
the data in a variable in our node program and it was then even shared across
requests or we stored it in a file and that's also not optimal because accessing
files is pretty slow, especially as we start storing more and more data in them
and it's therefore not really something we would do in a real application. 

Instead there, you typically would use a database which is a specific program
that allows you or that is built for storing data and for efficiently retrieving
data too. 

Therefore in this module, we'll have a look at the different kinds of databases
or two important different kinds of databases, SQL and NoSQL databases and I
will compare them, highlight the differences and we will actually see examples
for both in the course and we'll start with SQL also in this module, so NoSQL
will also follow in a separate module but let me first of all show you how you
would use a SQL based database together with your nodejs application. 

This is what we'll cover and that will actually be a lot, so let's dive right
into it and let's learn what the different kinds of databases are and whether a
SQL or NoSQL could be the right choice for your application.
