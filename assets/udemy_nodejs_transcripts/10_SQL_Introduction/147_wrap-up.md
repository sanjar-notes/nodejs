## 147. Wrap Up

<strong><em>no description</em></strong>

Now you could spend hours working on this application to add all the
functionalities we need, to add products to a cart or to also interact with
users, with orders and we can do all of that with these SQL queries we're
already writing here. 

The problem is the queries will get more and more complex the more complex our
application logic becomes and at some point, we'll have to connect tables
because one thing we're not using right now are relations because we only got
one table. 

Now we can do all of that just with the MySQL package and if you're a MySQL or a
SQL master in general, you can definitely do that. 

For the rest of us, there is a way easier approach to that which allows us to
not write all these queries, we don't have to write any SQL code but instead
only work with native javascript objects that give us certain functionalities we
need for connecting them, deleting them, adding them and so on. 

We'll use another third party package we can add to this application that makes
our life a bunch easier. 

I just wanted to show you how you generally can add SQL and write your own
queries, as a next step we'll not write our own queries, instead we'll find an
easier approach in the next module with sequelize.
