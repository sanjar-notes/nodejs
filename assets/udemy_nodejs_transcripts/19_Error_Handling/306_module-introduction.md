## 306. Module Introduction

<strong><em>no description</em></strong>

In this module let's have a look at something you can't avoid, errors. 

There will be errors in the applications, in the webpages you create and some
errors can of course be avoided by testing your code properly but some errors
are due to happen. 

You will always have some bugs or issues in your code and even if you don't,
your database server might be offline, users do send invalid data, so there will
be errors and in this module, we'll have a look at different types of errors and
how to handle these different types of errors in an elegant way in your node
express application.
