## 106. Module Introduction

<strong><em>no description</em></strong>

With the last module, we took a major step forward because whilst still a lot of
useful things like working with the database, authentication and so on are
missing, we now have the general pattern set and you should have a general
understanding of how a node and node express application works, how the flow is,
how you connect your different pieces and which part of your code plays which
role. 

So therefore this was a crucial part and now we're going to work a bit on the
course project and therefore we'll practice what you learned. 

We'll add a couple of new views and we'll try to move this a bit further in the
direction  of a more realistic online shop. 

Now one important note, this module is completely optional, you can of course
skip it and simply download the finished code which we'll add to this module at
the end of this module or in the first lecture of the next module. 

So if you're not interested in practicing this and adding all these new views
and controllers and you simply want to learn the next concept, you can skip
ahead, you can skip this module or fast forward through it otherwise let's dive
in and let's continue working on our course project.
