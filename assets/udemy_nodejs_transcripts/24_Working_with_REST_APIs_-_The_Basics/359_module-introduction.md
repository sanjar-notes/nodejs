## 359. Module Introduction

<strong><em>no description</em></strong>

You already learned a lot about nodejss and how to build amazing applications
with it and the express framework that builds up on nodejs. 

You learned a lot about reaching out to databases, handling requests, sending
responses, rendering templates, working with files, a lot of crucial things that
you will need for any node application you're going to build. 

Now I want to move away from one important thing that we always did thus far and
that's the rendering of templates with ejs. 

It's a common thing to do that in a lot of node applications but there also is a
very popular alternative kind of or a very common other kind of node application
that you will work with or that you will build as a web developer and that are
rest APIs. 

Now in this module, you will learn what exactly rest APIs are, why you would use
or build them instead of the classic node express application that we built thus
far where we rendered views. 

You will learn what the core rest concepts and principles are and we'll build
our first rest API in this module too. 

So let's dive in and let's understand what rest APIs are and why we would well
use them.
