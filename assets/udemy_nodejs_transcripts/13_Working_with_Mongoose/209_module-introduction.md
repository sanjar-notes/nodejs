## 209. Module Introduction

<strong><em>no description</em></strong>

In the last module, we had a closer look at NoSQL or especially mongodb and how
you can use such a NoSQL database in our course mongodb, the most popular NoSQL
database in a nodejs application. 

Hopefully you saw that it wasn't too difficult and still just as with SQL, we
can abstract some complexity away from us and focus more on our data than the
queries we write and here just as we had sequelize for SQL, we got mongoose for
mongodb and mongoose is indeed pretty similar to sequelize in terms of what it
tries to do, it tries to enable you to work with the data instead of with the
queries. 

So what's in this module? 

We'll have a look at what mongoose is in detail and how we can add it to our
project and how we can start using it and then we'll, well we will use it, we
will use it in our nodejs application, I will give you a thorough introduction
to mongoose, also show you where you can learn more about that if you want to
dive deeper and we will transform our project once again to move from a we write
all queries on our own approach to we just define how our data should look like
and then work with it approach. 

So with that, let's dive in.
