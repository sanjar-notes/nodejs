## 354. Module Introduction

<strong><em>no description</em></strong>

Before we move on to rest API features which is a whole new block or a whole new
way of interacting with the client and of which we got to taste with our
asynchronous javascript, before we do that, let's finish our online shop by
adding some payment functionality because what would be a shop without being
able to pay? 

Now for that in this module, we'll add a simple checkout page. 

We'll collect some payment data, so credit card data from our user and we'll
finally do the purchase, charge that credit card or at least simulate the charge
in this module and well of course then still store the order as we did it
before. 

Now for that, I'll use a third party provider, stripe which is a great provider
for integrating payment into your application and I will show you how to
integrate it step by step.
