## 176. Module Introduction

<strong><em>no description</em></strong>

We had a very detailed look at how you can use SQL based databases like MySQL to
store your application data and most importantly for us as node developers, how
you can interact with your MySQL database from inside nodejs. 

Now SQL based databases are popular, are great and are used a lot but there is
another very popular alternative which is used heavily and that is NoSQL or
NoSQL based databases especially mongodb . 

And in this module we'll have a look at mongodb, what it is and how you can
start up a mongodb database and most importantly of course, how you can use it
from inside your node code. 

So specifically I'll give you a short introduction to what mongodb is and why we
would use it, what the difference to SQL is, I also had a brief discussion about
this earlier in the SQL module. 

And then most importantly, we'll see how we used the so-called mongodb driver,
basically a package we install to interact with mongodb from inside our nodejs
applications. 

So let's dive into mongodb and see why it's awesome and why we could use it and
how we use it.
