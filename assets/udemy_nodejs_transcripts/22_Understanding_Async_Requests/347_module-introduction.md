## 347. Module Introduction

<strong><em>no description</em></strong>

Thus far in this course, we always had a look at a particular kind of request
and response. 

The request was always a request sent from our browser when we submitted a form
or entered a url or clicked a link and the response always was either a redirect
or a new html page. 

Now that can take you very far but sometimes you get some work, some requests
that will only happen behind the scenes, that means you don't want to get back a
new html page, you only want to exchange some data with the server for example
and I will show you what I mean and how this works in this module. 

So we'll have a look at what asynchronous javascript requests are, why we would
use them and how we will use them.
