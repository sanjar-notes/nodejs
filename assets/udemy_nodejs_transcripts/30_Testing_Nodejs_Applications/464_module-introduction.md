## 464. Module Introduction

<strong><em>no description</em></strong>

Now that you learned a lot about building node applications and different kinds
of node applications, server rendered views, rest APIs, GraphQL APIs now that
you learn all about that, which of course is the meat of building node
applications, let's have a look at testing. 

And with that, I don't mean the manual testing we did throughout the course
where we simply well visit our page or test our API by sending requests, which
is important. 

But I mean the automated testing which we can also set up where we write code to
test our code. 

So let's have a closer look at that.
