Now, Max, from the future here in the last lecture we added async await and I explained all about

00:08.900 --> 00:09.150
it.

00:09.170 --> 00:11.630
Now what I explained here is all correct.

00:11.630 --> 00:15.320
But there is one important addition I want to make here.

00:15.590 --> 00:23.600
Starting with version 14.3, which when I recorded this video was just released, starting with that

00:23.600 --> 00:25.340
version of Node.js.

00:25.370 --> 00:31.380
You can actually use the a wait keyword also outside of asynchronous function.

00:31.400 --> 00:34.370
This is a feature called Top Level Await.

00:34.400 --> 00:40.640
You would be able to await a promise which you have here in the top level of your script.

00:40.640 --> 00:45.890
So which is not inside of a function you can now also use await here.

00:45.920 --> 00:48.200
Previously this was not really possible.

00:48.200 --> 00:51.170
You always needed a async function around await.

00:51.200 --> 00:56.960
Now you can use a weight on the top level if you are using it instead of a function.

00:56.960 --> 01:02.060
As we are doing it here though, you still should add async, so that hasn't changed.

01:02.060 --> 01:07.340
It's just this extra addition that you could now also use await on the top level.

01:07.370 --> 01:13.430
And I just found this important to mention because it is part of Node.js and it is related to a single

01:13.430 --> 01:16.040
weight or to just a weight then I guess.
