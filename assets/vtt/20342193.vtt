00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:05.870
<v Instructor>Now this course was about Node.</v>

2
00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:08.530
Now if we flip around those characters,

3
00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:12.930
we actually arrive at a different technology, called Deno,

4
00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:15.530
or also pronounced as Deno.

5
00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:20.530
Apew, the creator of Deno, Deno, used both pronunciations.

6
00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.560
He started with Deno, that was when I got into it.

7
00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.110
So, well, I still am stuck to Deno,

8
00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:31.590
but in newer videos, he used Deno.

9
00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:32.620
I guess you can use either

10
00:00:32.620 --> 00:00:35.220
of the two ways of pronouncing it.

11
00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:40.220
And this module will be about that technology, Deno.

12
00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:45.370
I'll introduce you to Deno, which is an alternative to Node.

13
00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:49.179
Now, of course, there are many alternatives.

14
00:00:49.179 --> 00:00:51.420
PHP, for example, would be one.

15
00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.580
But Deno is an alternative to Node that was created

16
00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:59.760
by the inventor of Node, and it's very similar to Node.

17
00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.410
It also uses JavaScript, but there are some key differences.

18
00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:08.450
Therefore, in this module, I'll introduce you to Deno.

19
00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:09.840
I'll let you know what it is,

20
00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.580
why it exists, and how it differs from Node.

21
00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:18.100
I'll also show you that it is still quite similar to Node,

22
00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:22.730
and how you can transfer your Node knowledge to Deno,

23
00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:24.530
and, of course, in the end,

24
00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:26.476
I will also answer the question

25
00:01:26.476 --> 00:01:28.610
whether you want to do that.

26
00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:31.220
Whether there is a real advantage

27
00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:33.183
of switching from Node to Deno.
