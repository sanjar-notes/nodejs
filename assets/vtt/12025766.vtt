That's it for this module. We added a bunch of validation logic for signing up, logging in and creating

00:09.160 --> 00:15.790
products and you learned that this is a two step process of adding validators to your routes with that

00:15.790 --> 00:22.120
third party package we're using, express validator so that it's a two step process with adding these validators

00:22.120 --> 00:23.950
to the routes as middleware

00:23.950 --> 00:30.790
and then for this package we collect errors in our controllers and then we do something if we do find errors.

00:31.300 --> 00:37.850
Most commonly you would re-render that form page, so that page which wanted the user to input something and

00:37.900 --> 00:39.620
to provide a good user experience.

00:39.670 --> 00:46.090
You want to make sure that you keep the original input the user entered and that you show at least some

00:46.180 --> 00:52.390
error message that gives the user an idea that nothing was wrong on your server but that something was

00:52.390 --> 00:54.580
wrong with the user input instead.

00:54.790 --> 00:59.530
These are the core takeaways and other than that, I can only encourage you to play around with the

00:59.530 --> 01:02.730
different built-in validators, build your own ones

01:02.770 --> 01:10.260
and of course there are other solutions, other express or node packages for validation out there as well.

01:10.270 --> 01:15.260
This is a pretty popular package, pretty easy to use and I can only recommend using it

01:15.310 --> 01:20.680
but as always it's most important that you play around with these things and that you practice using

01:20.680 --> 01:21.110
it.
