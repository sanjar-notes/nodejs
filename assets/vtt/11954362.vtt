Now that we are able to sign up and sign in,

00:05.220 --> 00:07.370
we have to work on route protection.

00:07.410 --> 00:12.740
We already have a setup where we only show the menu options we should be able to interact with

00:12.960 --> 00:22.020
but even when I logout and therefore my session is gone, even when I do that, I can still manually

00:22.020 --> 00:28.200
enter admin add product and reach that page and I could even try to create a product here,

00:28.290 --> 00:33.900
I would fail then because there would be no user object on the backend where I tried to get the logged

00:33.900 --> 00:34.610
in user

00:34.710 --> 00:36.360
but this is not the user experience

00:36.360 --> 00:37.280
we want to offer,

00:37.320 --> 00:41.130
we don't even want to be able to load this page if we're not logged in

00:41.130 --> 00:44.480
and for that, we need to protect our routes.

00:44.490 --> 00:46.490
Now how do we protect routes?

00:46.770 --> 00:52.990
Well to protect routes, we want to check where the user is authenticated before we render back

00:53.010 --> 00:55.260
let's say the add product page.

00:55.260 --> 01:02.790
So in admin in the admin controller, in get add product which loads that page, before we render that

01:02.790 --> 01:08.220
page, I want to check if in the request session is logged in is set

01:08.550 --> 01:15.450
and to be precise, I want to check if it's not set because if this is not true, the user is not logged

01:15.450 --> 01:17.180
in

01:17.390 --> 01:21.490
and if the user is not logged in, then I want to redirect

01:21.710 --> 01:24.470
let's say to the login page like this.

01:24.470 --> 01:31.720
So then since I return here, this code will not execute and I won't load the added product page.

01:31.750 --> 01:33.930
So now let me try to reload this page,

01:33.940 --> 01:38.690
keep in mind I'm not logged in and I'm on the login page.

01:38.690 --> 01:39.370
So this works,

01:39.410 --> 01:43.350
I am redirected here because session logged in is not set.

01:43.700 --> 01:45.910
On the other hand if I do login now,

01:46.040 --> 01:52.310
so if I do enter my valid credentials here and I try to access add product,

01:52.410 --> 01:56.570
this does work because now I make it past this if check.

01:56.750 --> 02:02.740
Now this is a code we could add to every route which we want to protect but adding it like this is a

02:02.740 --> 02:04.420
bit cumbersome,

02:04.450 --> 02:10.800
so let me show you a better way of protecting our routes or a more scalable way in the next lecture.
