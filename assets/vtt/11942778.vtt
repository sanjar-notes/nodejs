Now in the last lecture, we did insert a product into our mongodb database which is awesome.

00:07.570 --> 00:13.690
Now I also want to see it and before we actually fetch it in our node application, let me show you

00:13.690 --> 00:16.060
another tool called compass.

00:16.060 --> 00:18.990
If you click on get mongodb on mongodb.com,

00:19.000 --> 00:23.320
you can choose that and you can download and install it for free as well.

00:23.320 --> 00:26.470
It's available for Windows, MacOS and Linux

00:26.620 --> 00:32.800
and once you get that installed, you can start your compass application on your machine

00:33.010 --> 00:38.260
and this essentially is a tool that gives you a graphical user interface to connect to your database

00:38.260 --> 00:40.060
and to interact with it.

00:40.060 --> 00:46.780
So let's wait for it starting up here and once it did start up, you can connect to it. Now to connect

00:46.780 --> 00:47.090
to it,

00:47.110 --> 00:52.630
let's go back to our mongodb cluster and click connect here and then click connect with mongodb

00:52.630 --> 00:58.230
Atlas, choose your operating system and then copy that url down there.

00:58.240 --> 01:08.200
Now one cool thing is if you now quickly close compass again and you restart it after you copied that

01:08.230 --> 01:09.280
url,

01:09.550 --> 01:12.400
it should tell you that it detected a connection string

01:12.400 --> 01:17.100
and if you click yes, it will insert the most important pieces here for you.

01:17.170 --> 01:23.530
Now you still need to choose how you want to connect, so make sure your username is correct and also

01:23.530 --> 01:25.210
enter the password for this user,

01:25.210 --> 01:31.210
you need to do this manually. All the defaults can be left as they are and you should be able to now

01:31.210 --> 01:33.840
connect to your database

01:33.940 --> 01:40.310
and here it is and interesting enough, you are to be precise, you are now connected to the database server

01:40.450 --> 01:45.010
and here you see a couple of databases, two default ones which you don't need to touch and which you

01:45.010 --> 01:45.700
shouldn't touch

01:45.820 --> 01:52.240
but then also your own one, shop. And the shop database here actually has a products collection as you

01:52.240 --> 01:57.050
can see and if we look into that products collection, in there

01:57.070 --> 01:59.480
we can see the documents that are stored in there

01:59.500 --> 02:01.930
and here is that one document we inserted,

02:01.960 --> 02:05.920
so it is one product we added in the last lecture.

02:05.920 --> 02:12.900
Now you can also insert documents and edit them inside of compass and check out the official compass docs

02:12.910 --> 02:15.850
to learn all about the features you can use here.

02:15.880 --> 02:21.490
I just want to use this as a nice visual support so that we can see our data before we fetch it in our

02:21.490 --> 02:22.380
node app.

02:22.390 --> 02:26.600
That being said obviously the data is not that useful to us here,

02:26.680 --> 02:33.270
so let's go back to nodejs and write some code so that we can use the product data on our shop pages

02:33.310 --> 02:35.800
again which we commented out at the moment.
