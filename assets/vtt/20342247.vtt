1
00:00:02.140 --> 00:00:04.350
<v Instructor>So we got started with Deno here,</v>

2
00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:08.950
we wrote some first basic Deno code to get good IDE support.

3
00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:11.630
Again, I'll switch back to the extensions.

4
00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:13.880
And there I'm just going to enable

5
00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:16.350
my Deno extension again here.

6
00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.500
And with that done, we can continue with development here.

7
00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:23.880
Let's now dig a bit deeper into Deno.

8
00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.120
And for that, it's important to understand how Deno code

9
00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:30.130
and features are being organized.

10
00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:34.220
We get those core APIs, the so called Namespace APIs.

11
00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:37.570
Which are built-in core functionalities,

12
00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:39.680
built-in utility functions as well

13
00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:44.680
like set timeout, like right file, so all these core APIs,

14
00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:48.850
which you can see here in those docs.

15
00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:51.913
These are core APIs built into Deno.

16
00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:55.580
Now, we also got the Standard Library,

17
00:00:55.580 --> 00:01:00.030
which is a set of modules which you have to import

18
00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.190
into your files in order to use them,

19
00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.320
but which are still being maintained by the Deno team.

20
00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:07.790
And then we got third party libraries

21
00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:09.690
which are maintained by the community.

22
00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:14.840
Now, the Deno Namespace APIs are stable,

23
00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:17.140
so they shouldn't really change anymore.

24
00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:19.580
And they are maintained by the core team.

25
00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:21.230
The Standard Library modules

26
00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:23.510
are also maintained by the team.

27
00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:25.970
But they're not necessarily stable.

28
00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:30.910
They're some things some features could still change.

29
00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:33.860
For third party libraries, as the name suggests,

30
00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:36.880
those are maintained by different community teams,

31
00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:38.790
not by the official Deno team,

32
00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:42.190
and therefore their stability and maturity also differs.

33
00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:45.250
Some libraries are very new, some libraries

34
00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:48.323
are heavily maintained and might be quite stable.

35
00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:53.450
Now the Namespace APIs are built into Deno, no installation,

36
00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:57.610
no imports are required to use those features,

37
00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:00.013
as you see here, with our right file extension.

38
00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:03.180
And that, of course is a difference

39
00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:06.890
compared to the Node core APIs.

40
00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:10.650
For those core APIs like the file system API,

41
00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:14.770
we of course needed to add an import to use it.

42
00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:17.550
That's a difference for these core Deno features,

43
00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:19.113
no import is needed.

44
00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:22.380
But if we then move a step further

45
00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:26.060
towards the Standard Library, we will need to import

46
00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:28.280
those modules in order to use them.

47
00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:30.520
We still don't need to install anything.

48
00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:33.020
But as you will see, installation is not really

49
00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:35.370
a thing in Deno scripts anyways,

50
00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:38.810
but we'll need to import those libraries to use them.

51
00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:40.370
That brings up the question,

52
00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:41.920
what is the Standard Library?

53
00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:43.663
And what's the node equivalent?

54
00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:47.140
Well, we can find out more about the Standard Library

55
00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:51.540
on the Deno page, Deno.land,

56
00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:54.690
and then there you find the Standard Library.

57
00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:56.970
And these are simply a bunch of packages,

58
00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:00.630
which in the end build up on the core APIs.

59
00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:03.960
And make certain things easier to use.

60
00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:06.200
You could build any kind of app

61
00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:09.400
with just a core runtime API.

62
00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:13.720
But it gets easier if you use some Standard Library modules,

63
00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:16.500
or even also some third party modules,

64
00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:20.420
which build up on those core APIs to make certain things

65
00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:23.690
like listening to incoming requests easier.

66
00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:25.200
And that's the whole idea.

67
00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:28.200
The Standard Library builds up on those core APIs

68
00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:31.683
and makes working with those APIs easier, you could say.

69
00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:35.540
Third party libraries have the same idea.

70
00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:37.820
There you also don't need to install anything,

71
00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:39.760
but you need to import them to use them.

72
00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:42.380
And they also build up on the core APIs.

73
00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:46.920
So those Namespace or runtime APIs are built into Deno.

74
00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:51.150
And they have a small set of low level core functionalities

75
00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:53.840
with which you could build everything,

76
00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:56.390
but doing so would be cumbersome, that's why we have

77
00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:59.290
the Standard Library and third party libraries.

78
00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:03.680
The third party modules that build up on those core APIs

79
00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:08.570
to make the integration of certain features easier.

80
00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:12.510
And therefore, let's now make the next logical step.

81
00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:16.270
And let's start using some Standard Library features,

82
00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:20.420
as this will also cover one important aspect of Deno.

83
00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:24.780
It will show you how we integrate our modules

84
00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:26.633
into our Deno code.
