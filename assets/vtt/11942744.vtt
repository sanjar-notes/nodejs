We had a very detailed look at how you can use SQL based databases like MySQL to store your application

00:09.080 --> 00:16.730
data and most importantly for us as node developers, how you can interact with your MySQL database from

00:16.760 --> 00:17.400
inside

00:17.400 --> 00:18.730
nodejs.

00:19.010 --> 00:26.240
Now SQL based databases are popular, are great and are used a lot but there is another very popular

00:26.240 --> 00:34.580
alternative which is used heavily and that is NoSQL or NoSQL based databases especially mongodb

00:34.580 --> 00:35.300
.

00:35.510 --> 00:37.490
And in this module we'll have a look at

00:37.490 --> 00:42.110
mongodb, what it is and how you can start up a mongodb database

00:42.110 --> 00:46.010
and most importantly of course, how you can use it from inside your node code.

00:46.280 --> 00:51.980
So specifically I'll give you a short introduction to what mongodb is and why we would use it,

00:51.980 --> 00:54.340
what the difference to SQL is,

00:54.380 --> 00:58.560
I also had a brief discussion about this earlier in the SQL module.

00:58.910 --> 01:03.440
And then most importantly, we'll see how we used the so-called mongodb driver,

01:03.470 --> 01:09.500
basically a package we install to interact with mongodb from inside our nodejs applications.

01:09.530 --> 01:14.620
So let's dive into mongodb and see why it's awesome and why we could use it and how we use it.
