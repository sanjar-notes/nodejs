00:02.300 --> 00:06.100
So let's dive into the most important question, what is nodejs?

00:06.110 --> 00:10.600
Nodejs is a javascript runtime

00:10.610 --> 00:12.230
and now what does this mean?

00:12.500 --> 00:20.960
You know javascript, it's a programming language you typically use in the browser to manipulate your dom,

00:21.110 --> 00:24.620
to manipulate the page which was loaded in the browser,

00:24.650 --> 00:31.520
for example to open a popup, a modal or add any kinds of effects because Javascript is a language that

00:31.520 --> 00:37.370
runs in the browser that allows you to interact with the page after it was loaded and it therefore is a

00:37.370 --> 00:42.620
crucial part when it comes to building interactive user interfaces in the browser,

00:42.620 --> 00:48.410
so whatever your users see. However javascript is not limited to that.

00:48.620 --> 00:56.930
Nodejs is a different version of javascript you could say, it is basically built on javascript, it adds

00:56.930 --> 01:02.300
some features to it, is not capable of doing some other things you can do with javascript in the browser,

01:02.450 --> 01:06.490
so it basically takes javascript and puts it into a different environment.

01:06.560 --> 01:10.280
It allows you to run javascript code on the server

01:10.280 --> 01:14.770
you could say, in theory not just on the server but on any machine though.

01:14.960 --> 01:21.860
So it basically allows you to run javascript not just in the browser but anywhere else like a normal

01:21.890 --> 01:28.460
programming language, like normal programs on your computer or some computer in the Internet effectively

01:28.460 --> 01:34.760
making it a great choice for building web applications that run on servers which are just computers

01:34.850 --> 01:36.850
running somewhere in the Internet.

01:37.010 --> 01:44.600
So in detail, this means that we can use nodejs to run javascript outside of the browser,

01:44.660 --> 01:46.340
that is the core takeaway,

01:46.340 --> 01:47.660
now how does this work

01:47.670 --> 01:57.500
technically? Well nodejs uses v8 and v8 simply is the name of the javascript engine built by Google

01:57.800 --> 02:00.880
that runs javascript in the browser,

02:00.920 --> 02:06.860
so back to the browser we now are. V8 is simply the name the creators gave their engine

02:06.920 --> 02:09.010
and what does an engine mean?

02:09.170 --> 02:15.650
Well it simply means that engine takes javascript code, the code running in your browser then or in node's

02:15.650 --> 02:17.380
case which builds up on v8,

02:17.420 --> 02:23.790
also the nodejs javascript code, it takes that javascript code and compiles it to machine code

02:23.930 --> 02:28.590
and this is what your browser does too, what v8 does in your browser.

02:28.610 --> 02:35.390
It does take your javascript code and compile it to machine code because that is the code that runs ultimately

02:35.660 --> 02:36.670
on your computer

02:36.740 --> 02:39.170
and that can be handled efficiently.

02:39.510 --> 02:45.920
Now this is done by v8, v8 itself is written in C++ but that doesn't really matter too

02:45.920 --> 02:46.670
much for you,

02:46.700 --> 02:50.440
you don't need to write any C++ code to use javascript or nodejs

02:50.510 --> 02:52.190
but nodejs

02:52.250 --> 03:00.110
basically takes that v8 codebase which is written in C++ and adds certain features like for example

03:00.110 --> 03:05.450
working with your local file system, opening files, reading files, deleting files,

03:05.570 --> 03:08.750
these are all things which are not possible in the browser,

03:08.780 --> 03:14.050
you can't access your local filesystem in the browser for security reasons, so this is not supported.

03:14.270 --> 03:18.590
Nodejs adds these features to v8's engine you could say

03:18.710 --> 03:20.730
so that you can suddenly do that. Now

03:20.750 --> 03:25.210
nodejs does not run in the browser so these restrictions still apply,

03:25.220 --> 03:27.120
there you use vanilla

03:27.140 --> 03:30.940
v8, so v8 only without the nodejs extensions

03:31.190 --> 03:37.820
but if you then install nodejs, you can use it to basically use that extended v8 version

03:37.970 --> 03:45.560
to run javascript scripts on your computer which then suddenly can access these new features because they

03:45.560 --> 03:51.620
don't run in the browser but are directly executed through that nodejs runtime you could say.

03:51.680 --> 03:58.340
So this is how that works together and what nodejs does. It allows you to run javascript on your computer

03:58.550 --> 04:05.300
and it adds useful functionalities to the javascript engine so that you can do more useful stuff there

04:05.380 --> 04:08.660
than you can do with browser side javascript.

04:08.660 --> 04:10.750
Now one important note maybe on this point

04:10.760 --> 04:16.520
also is that of course some features are also taken away. In the browser you use javascript to interact

04:16.520 --> 04:18.240
with the document object model,

04:18.260 --> 04:21.060
so with the html elements on your page,

04:21.170 --> 04:27.260
if you just execute a javascript file directly, you of course have no attached page and therefore these

04:27.260 --> 04:30.770
features are missing. But this is a lot of theory,

04:30.830 --> 04:37.550
why don't we just have a look at this and see how we can install and use nodejs and what it actually

04:37.550 --> 04:38.450
does for us.

04:38.450 --> 04:40.100
Let's do that in the next lecture.
