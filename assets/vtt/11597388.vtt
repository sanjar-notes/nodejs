00:02.110 --> 00:09.910
Now we added some ejs magic or some ejs templates here. One thing that is missing here is the layout

00:09.910 --> 00:18.580
functionality pug or handlebars gave us and indeed ejs doesn't have layouts but we can use so-called

00:18.680 --> 00:25.180
partials or includes, by the way a feature that pug and handlebars also know.

00:25.410 --> 00:32.170
The idea here is that you have some code blocks which you reuse in different parts of your templates

00:32.500 --> 00:36.070
and you can therefore just share them across your templates,

00:36.130 --> 00:38.820
so it's a bit like the opposite of a layout,

00:38.890 --> 00:46.360
instead of having one master layout where you put your individual view parts into, you have a couple

00:46.360 --> 00:53.770
of separated shared view parts which you can merge into the views you're creating and for that I'll create

00:53.800 --> 00:59.950
a new subfolder in the views folder which I call includes and that name is up to you. There

00:59.980 --> 01:07.210
I will create a couple of shared files or shared code blocks and which code do we share across all our

01:07.210 --> 01:08.000
views?

01:08.320 --> 01:15.400
Well we certainly share this part here where we have like the beginning of the html document including

01:15.400 --> 01:22.920
the title, including the main css even and then we share the body of each document so we also can outsource

01:22.950 --> 01:25.520
that even though it's not that much code right now

01:25.540 --> 01:29.960
but that might change if we have a common script that we import everywhere,

01:30.010 --> 01:34.150
we also share the navigation. So there are three include files

01:34.150 --> 01:38.220
I want to create here, head.ejs for the start of the document,

01:39.170 --> 01:45.940
end.ejs and of course you can name these files however you want and navigation.ejs.

01:46.310 --> 01:49.690
And now I'll just go to the 404.ejs file,

01:49.880 --> 01:51.540
grab the beginning of the page,

01:51.620 --> 01:57.500
everything that is shared, cut that out of here and move it into my head.ejs file.

01:57.860 --> 02:05.130
Now I just need to import this and this can be imported into the 404.ejs file by adding our ejs

02:05.140 --> 02:05.930
syntax,

02:05.930 --> 02:13.230
now with a minus and you use that if you want to output unescaped html code, that by the way means

02:13.230 --> 02:20.570
that by default if you have this syntax with the equal sign and you would render some variable that holds

02:20.570 --> 02:24.960
a string that holds html code, it would not render that html code

02:24.980 --> 02:31.670
but render it as text to avoid cross-site scripting attacks, with a minus you can avoid this and

02:31.670 --> 02:33.910
really render the html code.

02:34.100 --> 02:37.520
We can do this combined with a keyword offered by ejs,

02:37.670 --> 02:45.380
the include keyword which allows us to include a certain element into this page and then you close that

02:45.410 --> 02:48.820
with the normal ejs tag, without the minus.

02:48.830 --> 02:54.830
Now here in include, you simply add a string which holds the path to the file you want to include and

02:54.830 --> 02:58.720
you have to enter this path as it's seen from the file you're in,

02:58.730 --> 03:00.340
so the 404.ejs file

03:00.340 --> 03:01.590
is in the views folder

03:01.700 --> 03:09.040
so the file we want to include is in a subfolder. So we just have includes and then head.ejs

03:09.110 --> 03:12.320
and this will now take the html code in here

03:12.470 --> 03:15.730
and as I mentioned, then also render it here. Now

03:15.860 --> 03:21.720
let me save that and let's go to some route that doesn't exist

03:22.560 --> 03:27.590
and we still have a valid document here as we can prove if we open the page source,

03:27.630 --> 03:29.510
so this all works,

03:29.610 --> 03:33.650
now we're using an include. By the way if you use an equal sign here,

03:35.870 --> 03:39.140
you see now it gets rendered as text and that is what I meant,

03:39.170 --> 03:41.800
this is escaping the values

03:41.810 --> 03:43.200
so it's not rendering it,

03:43.250 --> 03:47.660
so if you had some script tag or anything fishy in there, it would not render it,

03:47.660 --> 03:50.340
it would just display it as text and therefore protect you

03:50.390 --> 03:55.490
but if you know what you're doing like we do here because we wrote the code we're including, we can and

03:55.490 --> 03:58.070
we should of course include it as html.

03:58.610 --> 04:03.490
So this is now using an include and we can now also use that for navigation,

04:03.610 --> 04:09.890
so let's take all that navigation code here, put it into the navigation.ejs file and in there, we'll

04:09.890 --> 04:12.670
also have to manage the active link again,

04:13.280 --> 04:14.960
I'll come back to that in a second,

04:14.960 --> 04:22.850
for now let's just go back to 404.ejs and here again, I will just include includes navigation.ejs

04:22.920 --> 04:28.910
and close that. And last but not least, the end of the document is also shared even though it's very

04:28.910 --> 04:29.580
short,

04:29.660 --> 04:35.720
let's move that closing body and html tag into end ejs and let's share this too,

04:35.720 --> 04:43.770
so here at the very end I will have include includes end.ejs, like this.

04:43.820 --> 04:50.150
Now with all that out of the way, I can still load this page just fine and it works.

04:50.150 --> 04:54.980
Now let's also implement this and this is of course a great practice for you too,

04:55.010 --> 04:56.850
so feel free to pause the video,

04:57.170 --> 05:00.860
let's also implement this for the other two templates we have.

05:02.860 --> 05:04.060
Were you successful?

05:04.300 --> 05:07.970
Let's try it for add-product.ejs, there

05:08.110 --> 05:12.270
we also want to take our common code here out,

05:12.400 --> 05:19.330
so the start of the document not the two links which are exclusive to this page here though, so which we

05:19.330 --> 05:29.820
really only need there but instead of the other part, we can now include our includes folder and there,

05:29.840 --> 05:36.910
head.ejs to bring back that start of the document here. In add-product, we

05:36.900 --> 05:39.750
obviously need to replace more like the header,

05:39.900 --> 05:46.170
so there we also should use include and then go to the includes folder, navigation,

05:46.170 --> 05:49.070
close that and close the tag

05:49.940 --> 05:56.440
and also the same for the end of the document since we did that before include, go to includes

05:56.780 --> 05:59.750
and then here includes and then there we have

05:59.810 --> 06:01.510
end.ejs.

06:01.790 --> 06:03.910
So now we get this in there too

06:04.070 --> 06:09.750
but of course one problem we face if we reload this page is that our active class is gone here,

06:10.100 --> 06:14.040
so we need to bring that back and mark this navigation item as active

06:14.090 --> 06:20.960
if we are on the add product page. Now for this, let's go back to the admin.js file real quick where we do

06:20.960 --> 06:28.040
render this route and there let's remember that we already added this path for pug and we can reuse

06:28.040 --> 06:29.290
that functionality.

06:29.330 --> 06:37.070
We can go to our navigation.ejs file and then add a class here and there simply output something

06:37.160 --> 06:38.740
rendered through ejs,

06:38.810 --> 06:45.920
we can do this inline with an equal sign so we don't need to enclose a block of html code and simply

06:45.920 --> 06:49.310
check if path is equal to

06:49.460 --> 06:55.970
and now the path here is /admin/addproduct,

06:56.000 --> 07:04.450
so basically the path which we define here and if this is equal, I'll use a ternary expression here

07:04.510 --> 07:07.230
which is an inline if statement in Javascript,

07:07.360 --> 07:12.890
so here we have the condition and if that is mapped, we now do whatever comes after the question mark.

07:12.910 --> 07:19.060
So then I want to render active here and since I'm inside the class text here, I will basically just

07:19.120 --> 07:21.910
add the active class, this is how you can read this,

07:21.910 --> 07:26.420
always keep in mind that this simply gets replaced with text when the template is rendered,

07:26.530 --> 07:29.090
so this will just become class equals active

07:29.590 --> 07:35.450
and then I add the else condition with a colon and else is just that I rendered nothing.

07:35.580 --> 07:37.350
And now I can copy that here,

07:37.460 --> 07:42.930
that class assignment and do the same for add product where this should belong, there where

07:42.930 --> 07:49.350
I did it originally, I should check for just slash because that is actually the path we set for the shop

07:49.560 --> 07:50.340
here in the shop.js,

07:50.410 --> 07:52.170
this path.

07:52.700 --> 07:58.380
So now I got this in place, I'm checking for the two different paths here and I render the active class based

07:58.380 --> 07:59.190
on that

07:59.460 --> 08:05.670
and therefore if we save all of that and we reload the page, we got add product added here.

08:05.670 --> 08:07.490
Now let's go to the shop.ejs

08:07.510 --> 08:09.830
file and there

08:09.840 --> 08:11.200
let's do the same.

08:11.250 --> 08:12.870
Keep the link

08:12.900 --> 08:18.660
which we need in that file, which is the product.css file and replace the other part with our general

08:18.660 --> 08:19.610
include,

08:19.980 --> 08:28.910
so in the includes folder, there we have the head.ejs file, replace the navigation as we did it before,

08:29.060 --> 08:39.610
so there we have include includes navigation.ejs and of course also replace

08:39.680 --> 08:41.240
the body of the document.

08:41.240 --> 08:50.750
So here we have include includes and ejs, like this.

08:50.750 --> 08:56.900
And now with that, if we save that too and we go to the shop page, it looks like it did before and we should still

08:56.900 --> 09:03.800
be able to use our application as we did before but now we're using includes which is kind of giving

09:03.800 --> 09:06.170
us the same experience as with layouts,

09:06.290 --> 09:12.290
we have to repeat all this include code all the time but that is okay and we still benefit from having

09:12.290 --> 09:13.550
shared code.

09:13.970 --> 09:19.970
So with that out of the way, we got ejs added and we'll continue to work with that throughout this course

09:20.120 --> 09:26.450
and I hope you got a solid understanding of why we use templating engines, which options you have and

09:26.450 --> 09:28.830
how they roughly differ and with that,

09:28.850 --> 09:31.010
you should of course be able to choose your favorite.
