00:02.170 --> 00:06.910
So let's now make sure that when we edit a product, we don't break our app as we're currently doing

00:06.910 --> 00:07.210
it

00:07.210 --> 00:11.040
if we enter something wrong but that we instead simply validate the input.

00:11.200 --> 00:18.190
Well we are validating it already because I do have all my validators added on the edit product route

00:18.210 --> 00:24.430
in the routes folder but in the controller action that belongs to that, we should also repeat the code

00:24.580 --> 00:25.910
from adding a product,

00:25.930 --> 00:31.630
so all that code where I fetch the errors and then check for the existence of errors, we should grab

00:31.630 --> 00:35.560
that and add it to post edit product as well

00:35.770 --> 00:38.110
and there before we start doing anything,

00:38.140 --> 00:47.110
so before we find a product, before we do that, I will actually use my validation errors if we got any

00:47.590 --> 00:54.020
and then re-render the page with the title of edit product, editing set to true because we are still

00:54.020 --> 00:55.030
in editing mode

00:56.220 --> 01:02.810
but has error also set to true and the product data populated like this, with the values the user entered.

01:02.900 --> 01:07.960
And with that if we save that, that's all we have to do because we're reusing the same view we use before,

01:07.980 --> 01:11.260
so we already got everything we need for outputting the errors

01:11.520 --> 01:17.780
and now if I do leave out that price field, I get title is not defined.

01:18.040 --> 01:18.400
Yeah

01:18.400 --> 01:24.900
here when I try to set the data which I return, here in this post edit product actions, it's all named

01:24.990 --> 01:27.520
updated title, updated price,

01:27.630 --> 01:28.730
so we should be using that.

01:28.740 --> 01:39.010
So let's use updated title here, updated price, updated image url and down there, it's updated desc,

01:39.040 --> 01:40.730
so this was a little mistake on my side,

01:40.750 --> 01:44.170
these values which I extracted were named differently.

01:44.170 --> 01:50.300
Now after renaming that if I try to submit this again, now I simply get invalid value, again

01:50.350 --> 01:56.460
you could override that default message in the way I showed it earlier in this module.

01:56.530 --> 01:59.830
We also see that our image url was lost,

02:02.490 --> 02:07.290
yeah but simply because I assign this incorrectly, I assign the price to the image url and the

02:07.300 --> 02:09.250
other way around.

02:09.420 --> 02:11.320
We should of course do it this way

02:11.640 --> 02:16.130
and now if I update this, now all the data is kept and I still get this error.

02:16.470 --> 02:18.650
So now we get this validation in place too,

02:18.660 --> 02:25.110
now one thing we can do of course we can again set that red border by repeating that same way we did

02:25.230 --> 02:32.640
in the login or in the sign up pages. We get our class here, we conditionally add a css class and

02:32.640 --> 02:34.580
we do the same in edit product,

02:34.770 --> 02:36.420
so there for this input

02:40.330 --> 02:48.340
I do add my class when there is an error for the title input, the same of course for the image url

02:48.430 --> 02:54.320
and all the other inputs, so that does not change. Here for the image url,

02:54.400 --> 03:01.090
I do get this css class here if we do have an error on the image url.

03:01.330 --> 03:04.030
Let's do the same for the price of course

03:04.030 --> 03:04.840
real quick,

03:04.930 --> 03:07.190
split up what we get thus far

03:09.520 --> 03:15.840
and then let's here check the price to see whether we add this invalid css class. And for the text area, it's

03:15.840 --> 03:17.140
exactly the same,

03:17.160 --> 03:23.490
we just need to do one little change to our css code because here I'm checking for description and

03:23.490 --> 03:31.110
so the invalid class might be added to that text area. Thus far in my css code, in the forms css

03:31.110 --> 03:31.750
file,

03:31.920 --> 03:36.800
I only add or change the text color if invalid was added to the input,

03:37.020 --> 03:41.800
now we should simply group another selector or add another selector to that group here

03:42.060 --> 03:47.480
and simply check whether invalid is added either to an input or to a text area

03:47.580 --> 03:53.880
and in both cases give it a red colored border. And with that in place, we now just have to make sure

03:54.300 --> 04:00.910
that we pass these validation errors which we are checking in edit product now, that we passed that

04:00.930 --> 04:02.430
with our responses.

04:02.490 --> 04:09.660
So in the admin controller starting with get add product, there validation errors should be an empty

04:09.660 --> 04:16.860
array because we got no validation errors in this place, for post add product however, here we should have

04:16.860 --> 04:20.530
validation errors which is equal to errors array,

04:20.640 --> 04:26.450
so these errors which we did fetch. For get edit product,

04:26.590 --> 04:32.650
there again I will pass validation errors as an empty array because we have no errors here when we just

04:33.010 --> 04:34.350
get the page

04:34.600 --> 04:41.230
but for post edit product when we do return our error page basically, then I want to set validation

04:41.230 --> 04:44.650
errors back to errors array like this.

04:44.650 --> 04:46.510
And now we do pass that data

04:46.660 --> 04:57.510
so if I now hit update here, you see this is red, only interesting pieces, the title is red as well.

04:57.780 --> 05:04.920
Well that makes sense because here I still have something in my validation set up in the routes folder,

05:05.580 --> 05:07.060
here alphanumeric,

05:07.080 --> 05:12.930
we did remove that if you remember because it should be isString otherwise the whitespace, the blank is

05:12.930 --> 05:14.190
not allowed.

05:14.190 --> 05:21.530
So if I change that and I hit update now, I actually fail and I do fail

05:22.330 --> 05:26.350
because the cast to object id failed for that value.

05:26.380 --> 05:28.520
Now what's wrong here?

05:29.450 --> 05:36.510
Well keep in mind for editing, we need that hidden input where I do have my product ID right

05:36.640 --> 05:41.050
and I do load that product ID when I first render this page

05:41.440 --> 05:50.280
but if I re-rendered it due to a validation error, so due to this render function in my if check here,

05:50.590 --> 05:55.020
well then I only set title, image url, price and description.

05:55.240 --> 06:03.010
I also need to set _id though, otherwise it will render the page

06:03.030 --> 06:08.320
but if I try to submit it that ID will be missing and I need that ID because I extract it here.

06:09.860 --> 06:16.100
So what I should do is I should simply pass _id here and set this equal to prod ID which

06:16.100 --> 06:19.420
I am extracting when this is submitted the first time.

06:19.470 --> 06:21.440
So now I'm passing _id

06:21.890 --> 06:32.470
and this means that if I now go to admin products, edit this and let's say I change the price,

06:32.530 --> 06:33.280
this works

06:33.310 --> 06:36.450
but now let's also do something that breaks validation,

06:36.760 --> 06:41.800
so now this was reloaded due to our failing validation.

06:41.930 --> 06:49.540
And now if I edit this, it will still work because now we also did store and re-render that product ID

06:49.840 --> 06:55.260
and that is how we can add validation and provide a relatively good user experience.
