Now one thing we did in the last lectures is we used the express router and right now, we have a set

00:08.210 --> 00:15.500
up where we also have some unhandled routes. If we enter some random string here, we get this error.

00:15.510 --> 00:22.930
Now typically, we would want to see a 404 error page and we can do that. Back in the app.js file,

00:22.950 --> 00:29.450
we can take advantage of the middlewares or the way express uses the middlewares and funnels the

00:29.460 --> 00:31.290
request through them.

00:31.320 --> 00:34.630
Remember that the request goes from top to bottom

00:34.770 --> 00:41.310
so if it finds some middleware that handles it, it will go in there and then for example here for slash

00:41.310 --> 00:44.000
with that get method on the router, we would actually

00:44.000 --> 00:46.370
end here, we also get no next call here

00:46.410 --> 00:52.970
so no other middleware would be executed. But if we got no fitting middleware and we don't have one here,

00:53.580 --> 00:59.090
then we actually make it all the way to the bottom and eventually we don't handle that request.

00:59.400 --> 01:07.200
So to send a 404 error page, we simply have to add a catch all middleware at the bottom where we don't

01:07.200 --> 01:11.560
need a path filter but we could add slash but that's the default anyways 

01:11.940 --> 01:15.190
and then simply handle request response next

01:15.240 --> 01:23.110
since I use use here, this will also handle all http methods, not just get requests and there,

01:23.110 --> 01:29.390
I can then also send some code like Page Not Found.

01:29.530 --> 01:37.060
So little dummy html document and maybe we also want to set the 404 status code and you can do that

01:37.060 --> 01:42.940
by chaining another method prior to send and that is the status method

01:43.120 --> 01:45.180
and of course you cannot just use that here,

01:45.220 --> 01:48.260
you could have used it here or in the admin.js file too.

01:48.280 --> 01:53.930
So always before sending, you can call status to or set header,

01:54.010 --> 02:00.050
you can actually chain all these method calls, send just has to be the last one.

02:00.280 --> 02:06.160
So here I'm calling status to set my status code, another convenience method added by expressjs

02:06.490 --> 02:13.460
and I'll set it to 404 which is the common code for a page was not found. With this added,

02:13.510 --> 02:24.230
if I save this and then I now reload my dummy path here, I get page not found whereas for add product, I still

02:24.230 --> 02:25.180
get that form,

02:25.190 --> 02:26.600
so this is still working,

02:26.630 --> 02:28.340
the rest however changed.
