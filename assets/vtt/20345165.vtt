00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:05.500
<v Instructor>In the previous module, we took a first look</v>

2
00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:09.020
at Deno, or Deno, however you wanna pronounce it,

3
00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:11.970
and I showed you how it relates to Note

4
00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:14.920
and also what some differences are.

5
00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:18.500
Now, in order to take you one step further

6
00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:22.030
and to really enable you to work with Deno

7
00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:24.370
as you're able to work with Note,

8
00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:27.840
in this module we'll have a closer look at Deno

9
00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.410
and we'll do a bit more with Deno.

10
00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:32.840
Specifically, in this module we're going

11
00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:36.260
to connect a front end to the rest API we built

12
00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:38.090
in the previous module.

13
00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:39.780
For that, of course, you should make sure

14
00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.850
that you go through that last module, of course,

15
00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:46.560
also to pick up the basics about Deno in general,

16
00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:49.100
and besides connecting a front end,

17
00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:53.420
we'll also connect a database, MongoDB in this example,

18
00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:56.400
so that you also see how Deno could interact

19
00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:57.530
with a database,

20
00:00:57.530 --> 00:00:58.773
so let's get started.
