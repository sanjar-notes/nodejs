So everything works but when clicking add to cart, it would be nice if we don't get stuck here,

00:07.630 --> 00:09.520
so something seems to be wrong.

00:09.760 --> 00:11.440
If we have a look at post cart,

00:11.830 --> 00:15.030
well the thing is we never send a response here, 

00:15.430 --> 00:19.970
we do add our product to a cart but that's it.

00:19.970 --> 00:26.820
Now in the old code, we redirected to /cart and that is what we should do here too,

00:26.830 --> 00:29.920
so instead of returning this result which doesn't matter,

00:29.920 --> 00:31.140
no one's interested here,

00:31.210 --> 00:34.320
I just want to call res redirect here

00:34.420 --> 00:36.910
or not here but here

00:36.910 --> 00:40.950
and then I guess we can return this to see the result of that operation here if we wanted to

00:41.020 --> 00:45.910
but the important part is that we redirect at some point. With that,

00:46.060 --> 00:51.200
now if I click add to cart here, I'm redirected to the cart page,

00:51.200 --> 00:52.070
awesome.

00:52.070 --> 00:55.040
Now let's make sure we can delete cart items.

00:55.040 --> 01:00.280
As always feel free to try this on your own, in the next lecture and thereafter, we'll do this together.
