In the last lecture we wrote our first little nodejs server.

00:06.820 --> 00:09.510
Now this server is not doing all it should do,

00:09.510 --> 00:16.330
it's not returning a response for example but it's generally showing us how we do create server side

00:16.330 --> 00:20.280
code with nodejs and how we do create our own servers.

00:20.290 --> 00:22.240
Now let's understand what happened there,

00:22.270 --> 00:24.600
we executed that file with node app.js

00:24.680 --> 00:31.840
because our file was named app.js and this essentially started the script where nodejs went through

00:31.840 --> 00:36.880
the entire file, parsed the code, registered the variables and functions and so on,

00:36.880 --> 00:40.770
so it basically read our entire code and started executing it.

00:41.080 --> 00:42.870
But then something important happened,

00:43.000 --> 00:46.090
we never left that program, right.

00:46.090 --> 00:52.030
The reason for this is an important concept in nodejs called the event loop, this is basically

00:52.090 --> 00:59.760
a loop process which is managed by nodejs which keeps on running as long as there is work to do

00:59.760 --> 01:06.190
you could say, it keeps on running as long as there are event listeners registered and one event listener

01:06.190 --> 01:14.200
we did register and we never unregistered is that incoming request listener we passed or we set up with

01:14.200 --> 01:15.680
the help of create server.

01:15.820 --> 01:17.610
We passed a function to create server

01:17.770 --> 01:20.410
and that is basically an ongoing event

01:20.420 --> 01:26.410
listener, one we didn't unregister from and we shouldn't because our server should of course stay up

01:26.410 --> 01:27.180
and running.

01:27.460 --> 01:35.020
So our core node application basically is managed by this event loop, all our code is managed by this

01:35.140 --> 01:41.710
and as I mentioned, nodejs uses such an event driven approach for all kinds of stuff, not just for managing

01:41.710 --> 01:44.620
that server but that is of course a crucial part

01:44.620 --> 01:46.800
but you will see it a lot throughout this course,

01:46.840 --> 01:53.350
for example when we later access a database, you will see that there we also basically send that please

01:53.410 --> 01:58.220
insert some data request and then we register some function that should be executed

01:58.300 --> 02:07.000
once it's done. And nodejs uses this pattern because it actually executes single threaded javascript. So the

02:07.000 --> 02:13.480
entire node process basically uses one thread on our computer it's running on.

02:13.480 --> 02:20.260
Now as you might guess if we create a server with nodejs, it should of course be able to handle multiple,

02:20.320 --> 02:25.690
thousands, tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of incoming requests

02:25.690 --> 02:31.430
and if it would always pause and then do something with that request, this would not be that great

02:31.450 --> 02:38.230
hence it uses this event loop concept where in the end it always keeps on running and just executes

02:38.230 --> 02:40.360
code when a certain event occurs

02:40.510 --> 02:47.200
so that in general it's always available. And whilst this might still sound like ok but if I got two incoming

02:47.200 --> 02:50.370
requests, it needs to handle two events,

02:50.380 --> 02:57.730
well it is super fast in handling these requests and actually behind the scenes, it does some multi-threading

02:57.820 --> 03:03.940
by leveraging the operating system. But this event loop is a core thing you have to keep in mind that

03:03.930 --> 03:10.210
nodejs basically has an ongoing loop as long as there are listeners and create server creates a listener

03:10.210 --> 03:11.690
which never stops

03:12.190 --> 03:19.180
but if you eventually were to unregister and you can do this with process.exit, it would end and

03:19.260 --> 03:20.500
we can see that too.

03:20.680 --> 03:29.610
If we go back to our code and after this line, we type process.exit and execute this function and

03:29.630 --> 03:32.200
we clear our console and we now repeat node

03:32.200 --> 03:33.930
app.js, you see

03:33.970 --> 03:38.110
it's now still running because this function never executed,

03:38.200 --> 03:47.450
we had no incoming request yet. But if we now reload this page, localhost 3000, you see we still log

03:47.450 --> 03:54.430
that request but then we're back in a new line in the terminal because now it did quit that process,

03:54.650 --> 03:56.700
it didn't before but now it did.

03:56.840 --> 04:01.100
It did quit that process with the help of process.exit.

04:01.140 --> 04:07.490
Now typically you don't call that in your code because you don't want to quit your server, if it quits

04:07.490 --> 04:12.640
people will not be able to reach your webpage anymore but this is important for understanding how this

04:12.740 --> 04:13.540
works.

04:13.550 --> 04:21.440
Process.exit basically hard exited our event loop and therefore the program shuts down because there

04:21.440 --> 04:22.960
was no more work to do, 

04:22.970 --> 04:25.640
nodejs saw that there is no more work to do

04:25.700 --> 04:30.980
and it basically closed the program and gave control back to our terminal here.

04:31.400 --> 04:38.510
So this is how we execute such a nodejs file and how we generally create such a server and what nodejs

04:38.750 --> 04:40.520
does behind the scenes,

04:41.380 --> 04:49.960
let's see how we can now also work with the request and with the response object we have in that anonymous

04:49.960 --> 04:50.760
function here.
