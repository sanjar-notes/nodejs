00:02.120 --> 00:04.760
So how does sending mails work?

00:05.030 --> 00:09.680
Well we obviously get our node server with our code and we get our user and we want to send an email

00:09.680 --> 00:11.010
to that user.

00:11.030 --> 00:19.400
Now it's super important to understand and a common misconception that node and expressjs, these are

00:19.510 --> 00:26.210
language or frameworks runtimes that we use for writing our server side logic but with nodejs,

00:26.420 --> 00:32.870
you can't trivially create a mailing server. Handling mails

00:32.870 --> 00:36.360
is totally different to handling incoming requests and responses,

00:36.380 --> 00:41.690
it's a totally different technology, something totally different happens behind the scenes.

00:41.690 --> 00:48.980
Therefore in reality, you will very likely never implement your own mail server because that is a very

00:48.980 --> 00:50.210
complex task,

00:50.330 --> 00:56.840
creating a mail server that is capable of handling thousands or one hundred thousands of e-mails

00:56.840 --> 01:02.290
at the same time, sending them and so on, security, all that stuff is highly complex,

01:02.300 --> 01:08.180
so in reality you typically use third party mail servers for that and that is exactly what we will

01:08.180 --> 01:09.310
do in this module too

01:09.350 --> 01:14.650
but I will show you how to interact with such a service to send that e-mail through that service.

01:14.780 --> 01:21.440
And by the way all major web applications you might be interacting with including Udemy don't have

01:21.440 --> 01:28.850
their own mail servers, they are using third party providers like AWS or whatever it is for sending

01:28.850 --> 01:29.420
e-mails,

01:29.510 --> 01:31.790
so that is exactly what we will do in this module too.
