WEBVTT

00:02.080 --> 00:08.500
In this module I want to dive into a very important aspect of building web applications, backend applications

00:08.800 --> 00:10.530
like the one we're building.

00:10.660 --> 00:15.330
We want to follow a certain pattern for structuring our code

00:15.340 --> 00:22.810
and with that, I don't really just mean how we split it over files or how we write the code but I mean

00:23.020 --> 00:30.100
how we logically separate our code and the different functions it fulfills or the different things it

00:30.100 --> 00:31.180
does.

00:31.180 --> 00:37.810
We'll dive into the MVC pattern and you'll understand in this module what this actually is and how we

00:37.810 --> 00:40.460
can add it in our project

00:40.540 --> 00:46.540
and of course we'll not just add it to the existing project but we'll also advance our project to get

00:46.540 --> 00:50.320
closer to that online shop we're building.
