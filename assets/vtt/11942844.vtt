Now one problem I just noticed when I clicked around and deleted some products here is of course that

00:07.960 --> 00:13.750
when I delete a product that wasn't a cart of a user as I have it here, I added one product behind the

00:13.750 --> 00:16.380
scenes to a user product with this ID

00:16.630 --> 00:22.860
and if we have a look at products and I don't want to update anything, if we have to look at products,

00:22.860 --> 00:27.040
this product ID is not the product ID I have in my cart here.

00:27.100 --> 00:32.560
So I deleted a product which was part of the carts of different users,

00:32.620 --> 00:35.320
now what would you do about that?

00:35.410 --> 00:40.690
For one it's important to notice that our app works correctly because when we try to load the cart, when

00:40.690 --> 00:47.230
we don't find the product data for an item in the cart, we just go ahead and well ignore that basically

00:47.230 --> 00:48.590
which is what we want here

00:48.760 --> 00:50.550
but how would you solve this?

00:50.890 --> 00:57.670
Well what you would do or what you could do, one approach that would makes sense is that you add some kind

00:57.730 --> 01:03.970
of worker process which is something a bit more advanced and not directly related to building web applications

01:03.970 --> 01:04.700
with node,

01:04.960 --> 01:12.430
basically a script that runs on the server and checks for such cases in your database once every 24

01:12.430 --> 01:19.480
hours or something like this, where you basically scan your users, your carts and look for products which

01:19.480 --> 01:21.610
you don't find in the product collection anymore

01:21.640 --> 01:26.770
and then you clean up these carts, that would be one thing you could do in an application to clean this

01:26.770 --> 01:32.320
up. Depending on your requirements, you could even have a cleanup script for the entire cart which resets

01:32.320 --> 01:38.290
the entire cart every 24 hours or every seven days. An alternative approach that you could of course look

01:38.290 --> 01:43.090
into would be that when you load the cart page as we are doing it here,

01:43.090 --> 01:49.900
so when you're calling get cart on the user and you know that there are cart items on the user object

01:50.230 --> 01:56.560
and still the products you get back is empty, then you know there's a mismatch between what you have

01:56.560 --> 01:59.320
in your cart and what's in the database

01:59.470 --> 02:04.100
and in such a case, you could then issue some behind the scenes request,

02:04.150 --> 02:11.320
so basically with exactly the tools you learned about to update the cart of that user to match the product

02:11.320 --> 02:13.020
you got back from the database.

02:13.030 --> 02:17.690
So if you got an empty product array and you have items in the cart, you want to reset your cart.

02:17.770 --> 02:23.320
If you've got less items in the data you get back from the database then that's in your cart, you want to

02:23.320 --> 02:26.700
find out what the difference is and then update your cart accordingly.

02:26.860 --> 02:32.490
So this would be strategies you could employ here. For now, I will move on and not focus on that as this

02:32.500 --> 02:37.810
of course also depends highly on your application needs but especially the second strategy is certainly

02:37.810 --> 02:41.080
something you can implement with the knowledge you learned in this module,

02:41.080 --> 02:47.020
so this would be a great challenge you can take to add the functionality to clean up your cart on the

02:47.020 --> 02:53.620
user collection whenever you find out that in get cart, there is a mismatch between the products you

02:53.620 --> 02:56.290
get back and the products you think you have in your cart.
