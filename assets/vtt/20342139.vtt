00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:05.020
<v Instructor>Now, that's it for the TypeScript Basics.</v>

2
00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:08.910
Of course, TypeScript has more to offer, way more,

3
00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:10.470
but as I mentioned multiple times,

4
00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:13.680
I got a course for that if you're interested in this.

5
00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:16.070
With these basics, you got everything you need

6
00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:17.950
to go through that course,

7
00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:19.640
and you will also learn TypeScript

8
00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:22.300
along the way in this course.

9
00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:25.130
These basics are all you need here, and with that,

10
00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:28.010
maybe TypeScript also looks quite interesting to you.

11
00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:30.090
In that case, I'm of course also happy

12
00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.053
to welcome you in my TypeScript course.
