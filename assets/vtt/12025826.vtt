Now that we know how to work with errors and now that we learned a lot about node express in general,

00:09.160 --> 00:15.940
let me dive into a little more advanced or specialized topic, file uploads and downloads.

00:16.030 --> 00:22.360
Now it's actually not something that rare, you'll often have a feature like this on your web page and

00:22.360 --> 00:28.660
therefore it is important to understand how you can allow your users to upload files and how you can

00:28.660 --> 00:36.040
handle that on your server side and which different possibilities you have for returning files to your

00:36.040 --> 00:36.820
users.

00:36.820 --> 00:42.880
So this is essentially what we'll dive into in this module. We'll have a look at how to upload files and

00:42.910 --> 00:46.010
most importantly how to handle them on the server

00:46.240 --> 00:50.930
and of course we'll then have a look at the different options you have for returning files.

00:51.160 --> 00:52.060
So let's dive in.
