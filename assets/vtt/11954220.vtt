If you download the attached project snapshot which is my latest snapshot, you will see some differences

00:08.850 --> 00:09.130
there,

00:09.130 --> 00:10.780
so you should download it

00:10.840 --> 00:12.150
and what did I change

00:12.160 --> 00:16.600
and of course you can also go ahead and just implement these changes in your project.

00:16.810 --> 00:26.350
Well I commented out my links to the add product and admin products pages in my navigation.ejs file

00:26.590 --> 00:30.150
and I added a new unordered list after the first one

00:30.250 --> 00:34.450
and there I added a new list item which is named login.

00:34.690 --> 00:36.900
And then I also worked on the styles a bit

00:37.030 --> 00:43.150
and most importantly in the styles, I had changed my main header nav to be of type display flex, header

00:43.150 --> 00:47.420
width of 100% and justify content space between

00:47.440 --> 00:51.230
but again you find these files attached to this video.

00:51.250 --> 00:57.670
Now this leads to a setup where two navigation items are missing but the login button was added and

00:57.670 --> 00:58.900
it's on the right

00:58.910 --> 01:01.340
here due to that space between thing.

01:01.720 --> 01:02.720
Now why did I add this?

01:02.740 --> 01:05.280
Because I want to have some dummy login page.

01:05.290 --> 01:11.820
We'll have a complete module on authentication where we dive deeper into all that is related to authenticating

01:11.920 --> 01:18.010
but here authentication is a great example for data you would want to store for a specific user and

01:18.010 --> 01:21.790
that is one of the typical use cases for using cookies and sessions

01:21.790 --> 01:27.000
hence I want to use some dummy authentication in this module already.

01:27.070 --> 01:28.580
So what can we do with that?

01:28.810 --> 01:35.490
Well with that login button, we navigate if we have a look at navigation.ejs, we navigate to 

01:35.500 --> 01:36.130
/login

01:36.150 --> 01:38.810
and that is a route which does not exist yet,

01:39.010 --> 01:44.690
we got no routes for logging in or signing up or anything like that.

01:44.740 --> 01:46.010
So I want to add this

01:46.140 --> 01:50.620
and if you don't want to practice this, again if that's not interesting to you, you can simply skip the

01:50.620 --> 01:51.460
next video,

01:51.460 --> 01:58.870
you can skip it and download the finished adjustments, the finished code after that next video so that you

01:58.870 --> 02:00.310
can continue with that.

02:00.310 --> 02:03.120
So in the next video, we'll implement that login screen,

02:03.130 --> 02:04.530
it's a great practice for you,

02:04.540 --> 02:09.760
you can also try it on your own before diving into my lecture where we do it together.

02:09.850 --> 02:13.180
And if you want to continue with cookies, immediately you skip the next lecture,

02:13.210 --> 02:15.700
you download the finished code and continue with that.
