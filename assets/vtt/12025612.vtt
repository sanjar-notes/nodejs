00:02.200 --> 00:07.440
So we added a very basic validation and we get back a message which we want your output.

00:07.510 --> 00:12.730
So this already shows us how we can work with that validation middleware, we see it rendered that page

00:12.730 --> 00:16.620
again and now we just need to make sure we don't output object object here

00:16.630 --> 00:22.050
but a real error message. We can do that in our sign up view of course,

00:22.240 --> 00:28.660
here we got our error message thing and the error message which I am outputting here is simply an object

00:28.870 --> 00:32.720
because it's that array and not a single field in there.

00:32.740 --> 00:37.950
Now we just need to adjust something and in the controller instead of returning an array,

00:37.950 --> 00:40.720
let's say we always want to return the first error message.

00:40.720 --> 00:43.500
Now obviously you could change this to change the overall logic

00:43.540 --> 00:47.630
and you need to change it in other controller actions then too to output all messages

00:47.650 --> 00:52.330
but for now let's say we simply take the first one which we are guaranteed to have because we'll have

00:52.330 --> 01:03.410
at least one error and then there, the message. And now if I save that and I do send just test again,

01:03.420 --> 01:05.070
now I get invalid value, so

01:05.070 --> 01:07.950
this is how we could output that message.

01:07.950 --> 01:09.900
We cannot just output the message,

01:09.900 --> 01:12.450
we can also customize it

01:12.840 --> 01:15.480
and we have to do that in the place where we added our middleware,

01:15.510 --> 01:19.050
so in the routes file. After isEmail,

01:19.200 --> 01:25.620
you can add do you with message function and this will always refer to the validation logic that was

01:25.620 --> 01:29.870
right before it because you could add multiple checks here,

01:29.970 --> 01:37.880
you could also add isAlphanumeric to check that it only contains numbers and characters, number and characters,

01:37.920 --> 01:43.770
so you could add multiple ones but with message, we'll always refer to the validation method right in

01:43.770 --> 01:44.610
front of it

01:44.700 --> 01:53.730
and there you could add please enter a valid email, something like that. And if you add this with message

01:53.730 --> 01:57.560
here, you will see that if I enter just some text here, I get

01:57.570 --> 01:59.400
please enter a valid email.

01:59.400 --> 02:04.030
So this is a way of working with the messages and also of customizing it

02:04.030 --> 02:07.170
and I also mentioned that you can add more validators.

02:07.200 --> 02:09.370
So let's have a look at this in the next lecture.
