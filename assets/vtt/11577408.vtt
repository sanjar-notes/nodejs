00:02.150 --> 00:08.450
Let's make sure we do set this active class on the right link depending on which page we are. Now for

00:08.470 --> 00:16.160
that, I will go to my routes and there since I'm working on the add product to the admin.js file where

00:16.160 --> 00:18.910
I do have that add product route, this one.

00:19.130 --> 00:21.440
Now I will return a new field here,

00:21.620 --> 00:30.280
the path field and I will set this to admin add product. Now you can set this to whatever you want, it

00:30.280 --> 00:34.680
doesn't have to match the path this route has, just a pattern I like.

00:34.690 --> 00:40.690
So now I pass this path into my view so that the view can find out what is the path for which this was

00:40.690 --> 00:41.680
loaded.

00:41.710 --> 00:44.230
Now in main layout, we will get this path

00:44.350 --> 00:48.390
and now I can do something interesting. In the main layout here,

00:48.580 --> 00:52.160
I know that I want to add the active class to this add product

00:52.300 --> 00:57.340
if the path and the path now simply is a variable i get passed into the page,

00:57.520 --> 01:04.000
if the path simply is this one and that is something we define and therefore you could pick any path you

01:04.000 --> 01:04.840
want.

01:04.840 --> 01:06.840
So now I will add a check here.

01:06.970 --> 01:10.750
Now a class can be added, a css class as an attribute here too,

01:10.780 --> 01:13.000
you don't have to use that dot notation,

01:13.150 --> 01:14.830
so class is equal to

01:14.980 --> 01:20.020
and now I'll have some javascript code which we can enclose with brackets here and now here, I simply

01:20.020 --> 01:28.480
check if path and path is simply just what I pass in here, so this key,

01:28.870 --> 01:37.310
if path is equal to this value and that is why I meant you can use whatever path you want, you are defining

01:37.310 --> 01:38.220
the condition here.

01:38.240 --> 01:45.260
So if path is equal to this, then I know that add product is the page I'm on because only for the add product

01:45.280 --> 01:48.160
route I do set this path.

01:48.190 --> 01:54.000
So then if that is the case, I want to render active as a class here

01:54.000 --> 01:55.050
otherwise an empty string,

01:55.050 --> 02:00.510
so otherwise I basically set no class. With this set up,

02:00.690 --> 02:06.990
now if I reload this page, you'll see add product is yellow because now it is marked as active,

02:07.200 --> 02:11.360
if I go to shop that's not the case but on shop, we also don't use the layout yet.

02:11.580 --> 02:12.330
So let's continue

02:12.330 --> 02:20.730
now. For the shop I also want to use the layout, so I will go to add-product.pug, copy my code here and

02:20.730 --> 02:23.000
move it up over to shop.pug,

02:23.340 --> 02:25.750
let's keep the original code for now,

02:25.750 --> 02:30.340
extend the main layout therefore. Now I do need the product.css file here

02:30.480 --> 02:35.340
but I don't need the forms so let's remove that from the styles block and for the content I will

02:35.340 --> 02:36.020
need main

02:36.030 --> 02:37.890
but we don't render a form here,

02:37.890 --> 02:42.080
instead we render this if loop, so let's or this if block,

02:42.090 --> 02:45.110
so let's copy that entire code and put it in here,

02:45.180 --> 02:48.960
make sure indentation is correct that you don't mess this up

02:49.050 --> 02:52.280
and now we can get rid of all the other code here.

02:54.760 --> 03:02.990
Now again for the styling of the header, we would have a problem if I now reload because it's not marked

03:02.990 --> 03:09.230
as active because I need to use that same approach I did for the add product route. I pass in an additional

03:09.230 --> 03:16.220
key path and there, I pass slash like this or /shop,

03:16.220 --> 03:19.620
again you don't have to use the real path that led to this route.

03:19.700 --> 03:22.310
I'll use slash though to keep this matched

03:22.430 --> 03:29.870
and now in main layout, I copy my code from down there where I dynamically add this class and add it here

03:29.870 --> 03:31.130
for the shop too

03:31.250 --> 03:36.490
but the part I'm checking for is just slash here and now I do add active here

03:36.590 --> 03:44.380
if the path variable which gets injected into the template matches slash which is only the case for this route.

03:44.630 --> 03:48.670
So now if I save this, I got an error here

03:49.000 --> 03:49.400
yeah

03:49.680 --> 03:50.900
this should not be an equal sign here,

03:50.910 --> 03:52.670
this should be a colon in shop.js

03:52.710 --> 03:53.340
.

03:53.430 --> 03:55.690
because we're creating a javascript object

03:56.010 --> 04:00.110
and now if I reload here, this is active,

04:00.230 --> 04:01.530
this is active 

04:02.090 --> 04:05.590
and if we try adding a book, this also works.

04:05.600 --> 04:07.050
So this is now working.

04:07.110 --> 04:11.320
Now there is one thing I saw that I forgot and that is the title for the page,

04:11.360 --> 04:12.980
it's always page not found

04:13.010 --> 04:15.380
and that should of course not be the case.

04:15.380 --> 04:21.440
Now you could turn this title into a block which you then set from inside the template or you do

04:21.440 --> 04:28.660
add a dynamic output here with hashtag curly braces and give this a name, page title maybe

04:28.730 --> 04:35.270
and now you just need to make sure that every render function passes in a page title.

04:35.390 --> 04:44.290
So for the 404 page, for the add product page and the shop page, we have to pass in that page title key.

04:44.900 --> 04:52.890
So starting in admin.js, here we already got page title so we're fine, in shop.js here it's doc title

04:52.910 --> 04:59.940
so let's rename this to page title to be in line with the other file and with our layout and in the app.js

04:59.960 --> 05:02.680
file where we have our 404 route,

05:02.690 --> 05:04.450
I'm not passing anything

05:04.490 --> 05:09.960
so there let's also send some data into the view and let's also set

05:10.010 --> 05:10.960
page title here,

05:11.030 --> 05:12.800
page not found.

05:12.950 --> 05:20.630
If we now go to our page and reload it, we see shop here as a title, for add product we see add product

05:20.900 --> 05:24.110
and if we enter something random here, we see Page Not Found.

05:24.380 --> 05:25.530
So now this is working

05:25.580 --> 05:27.180
and now we're using pug.

05:27.290 --> 05:32.600
Now you can do way more with pug and you can combine all these features and do crazy stuff,

05:32.810 --> 05:35.140
I recommend diving into their official docs

05:35.150 --> 05:39.990
if you plan on using that, I instead want to show you the alternatives too

05:40.070 --> 05:46.220
now that we learned the basics of how templating engines work and how you can use them to output dynamic

05:46.220 --> 05:48.110
content in your views.
