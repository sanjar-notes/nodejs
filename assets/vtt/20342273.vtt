00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:04.680
<v Instructor>So it's time for a comparison,</v>

2
00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:06.211
which one is better?

3
00:00:06.211 --> 00:00:10.414
Well, as you saw since we built both dummy APIs,

4
00:00:10.414 --> 00:00:12.960
there aren't too many differences

5
00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.880
but of course there are some small differences

6
00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:19.160
which of course can also be tricky to wrap your head around.

7
00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:21.040
If you would compare the code though,

8
00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:23.240
it's really not too different

9
00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:24.880
and that's a good thing.

10
00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:29.420
It means that switching from Node to Deno will be easy.

11
00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:32.500
Of course, also the other way around though.

12
00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:34.460
There are some core differences

13
00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:36.760
in the philosophies, of course.

14
00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:39.100
The permission thing is an important difference.

15
00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:42.100
The fact that Deno embraces

16
00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:44.650
modern JavaScript and TypeScript

17
00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:47.210
out of the box so that you don't need to bring

18
00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:52.015
any extra tools or opt into extra experimental features

19
00:00:52.015 --> 00:00:55.520
that of course also can be very nice.

20
00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:59.000
That being said though, Deno overall of course

21
00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.256
is still pretty new.

22
00:01:01.256 --> 00:01:04.380
If we compare Deno to Node,

23
00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:07.800
then we of course have all those different features.

24
00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:11.410
We of course have the different philosophies

25
00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:13.680
also because Deno is simply

26
00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.083
more modern than Node, it's way newer.

27
00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.480
But we also have one other key difference

28
00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:23.570
which is a disadvantage for Deno.

29
00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:25.940
And that's the fact that it is very new.

30
00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:28.100
Because of that, it can offer

31
00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:30.450
all those shiny new features.

32
00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.940
It has all those cool features built in,

33
00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:36.710
but of course it also means we have no big ecosystem

34
00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:39.350
that we certainly still have bugs in there

35
00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:41.000
that we will see changes

36
00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.380
to some of the core libraries and modules

37
00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:47.160
that we don't know which third-party modules

38
00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:49.520
will survive and which ones won't.

39
00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:52.940
And that overall, it's not really getting used

40
00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:57.719
by any production applications or bigger companies.

41
00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:59.140
Node on the other hand,

42
00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:02.590
certainly doesn't have all those shiny features built in

43
00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:04.410
and it has a different philosophy

44
00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:05.900
when it comes to permissions

45
00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:08.470
and when it comes to the modules system

46
00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:11.230
where you have to install everything locally.

47
00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:14.210
But for one, of course you might prefer that

48
00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:17.020
so that might not even be a disadvantage.

49
00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:20.820
And in addition, even if you prefer Deno's approach,

50
00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:24.300
you still of course have the huge advantage for Node

51
00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:26.490
that it is mature and established,

52
00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:29.120
that we have no real major bugs in there,

53
00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:31.420
that it has a very strong ecosystem,

54
00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:33.510
that it's actively maintained

55
00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:35.470
by a lot of contributors,

56
00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:39.110
that we have thousands of third-party packages

57
00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:41.670
which we can use with Node that help you

58
00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:44.920
solve any problem you could face along the way,

59
00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:47.600
and that is of course getting used

60
00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:50.910
by thousands of companies and developers out there.

61
00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:54.240
You not only find more resources on Node,

62
00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:57.730
you'll also find more jobs and employers.

63
00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:00.480
And personally, I think it's unlikely

64
00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.290
that a lot of companies will now

65
00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:04.920
start replacing Node with Deno.

66
00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:07.030
Some might, but certainly not all

67
00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:09.830
and probably not right now.

68
00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:11.520
So, when it comes to deciding

69
00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:14.250
which one you should continue with,

70
00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:16.560
it comes down to which features matters to you.

71
00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:18.420
Which style do you prefer?

72
00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:20.650
Is that permission thing important to you?

73
00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:22.740
Do you like the URL imports

74
00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:25.378
instead of local installations?

75
00:03:25.378 --> 00:03:29.034
Or do you maybe prefer Node's approach?

76
00:03:29.034 --> 00:03:31.760
But besides that, the maturity in the ecosystem

77
00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:33.140
should also matter to you.

78
00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:36.030
And there, as I said, Deno is very new

79
00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:38.860
and very immature so of course

80
00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:42.210
here we have a lot of advantages on Node's side.

81
00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:44.260
So my recommendation would be that,

82
00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:45.870
at the moment at least,

83
00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:49.400
you look into Deno, you play around with it

84
00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:53.610
but you mainly use it for side and dummy projects.

85
00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:56.160
And it's really important to realize

86
00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:58.720
and keep in mind that Node is established

87
00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:00.750
and it's not going to go anywhere.

88
00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:04.032
So even if Deno is going to become bigger,

89
00:04:04.032 --> 00:04:07.450
learning Node will never be wrong.

90
00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:10.090
You would be able to switch to Deno easily

91
00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:13.220
so even if you need to do that, it won't be hard.

92
00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:15.570
But chances are high that Node

93
00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:19.920
is not just not going anywhere today, but also tomorrow.

94
00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:23.060
It's getting used by so many large companies.

95
00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:26.120
It has this established ecosystem,

96
00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:28.210
it has a proven track record.

97
00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:31.140
And the disadvantages of Node,

98
00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:33.350
which are being fixed by Deno,

99
00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:36.323
simply might not matter too much to you.

100
00:04:36.323 --> 00:04:38.210
So what you'll learn in this course

101
00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:40.370
is everything but obsolete.

102
00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:42.240
It's completely up to date

103
00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:44.310
and more important than ever before.

104
00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:48.209
Deno is a nice alternative which is worth exploring

105
00:04:48.209 --> 00:04:51.910
and hopefully this module got you started with it,

106
00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:54.360
but it's not like you should start

107
00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:57.930
replacing everything with Deno now immediately.

108
00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:00.150
That is certainly not the case,

109
00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:02.713
and that might never be the case.
