00:02.130 --> 00:09.860
Now with all of the theory out of the way, let's build our first simple rest API and for that, I'm in

00:09.870 --> 00:11.420
a brand new folder,

00:11.490 --> 00:16.790
I only did one thing in there, I ran npm init and confirmed all the default settings,

00:17.950 --> 00:23.980
since I'm using version control I also added a gitignore file so that I can ignore an upcoming node module's

00:23.980 --> 00:25.990
folder and that is it.

00:26.170 --> 00:27.850
Now to build a rest

00:27.850 --> 00:29.950
API, how do we start?

00:29.950 --> 00:33.600
Well as I mentioned, all the things you learned are still important.

00:33.670 --> 00:37.610
We build a node express server just as we did before

00:37.930 --> 00:44.320
and also by the way, of course you don't need to use express, you could build just a node server API but

00:44.320 --> 00:49.350
you have to do a lot of request parsing and so on on your own as you learned it before in this course and

00:49.420 --> 00:54.800
you can use other frameworks too. There even are specialized rest API frameworks

00:54.970 --> 01:03.050
but we will use express which is a great all-rounder and therefore I will install as a production dependency

01:03.050 --> 01:09.470
with --save express, we need expressjs to build an API conveniently.

01:09.470 --> 01:13.670
So this is the first dependency we'll install into this brand new project here.

01:14.580 --> 01:20.880
Now with that installed, I'll also install another package and that will be a development dependency with

01:20.880 --> 01:22.290
--save dev

01:22.530 --> 01:28.040
nodemon because I still don't want to restart my server manually after every change,

01:28.140 --> 01:30.500
so let's quickly install that package now.

01:31.490 --> 01:35.620
With nodemon installed, let's go to the package.json file,

01:35.630 --> 01:42.440
let's add a start script in the scripts section and let's execute nodemon app.js here to start

01:42.440 --> 01:45.940
app.js with nodemon. App.js does not exist yet

01:45.950 --> 01:49.110
so let's add it and in there we'll set up our nodejs

01:49.140 --> 01:50.470
server.

01:50.900 --> 01:52.620
So what do we do in here?

01:52.880 --> 01:59.710
Well first of all, I will import express by requiring express like this,

01:59.710 --> 02:07.250
then I want to create my express app by executing express as a function and these are of course the

02:07.250 --> 02:10.870
exact same steps we executed before in this course

02:11.100 --> 02:15.830
and last but not least, we can listen to incoming requests,

02:15.860 --> 02:19.390
let's say on port 8080 this time, not 

02:19.390 --> 02:20.490
3000, I'll

02:20.510 --> 02:22.290
need to add later for something else,

02:22.400 --> 02:24.590
let's use 8080 for now.

02:24.710 --> 02:29.780
This is a very simple server that we could now start and that will not do anything of course,

02:29.780 --> 02:35.720
it has no routes to find but this is our simplest possible node express server.

02:35.720 --> 02:42.800
Now to add some routes and to do something with them, I will also install the body parser as a production

02:42.800 --> 02:46.310
dependency with --save so that I can parse

02:46.380 --> 02:49.710
well incoming request bodies

02:49.810 --> 02:57.180
and now let's start adding some routes. We could add them in here with app use to handle any method

02:57.360 --> 03:05.520
or app get, app post, app put and so on to handle specific http methods for specific paths

03:05.820 --> 03:12.120
but I will use the express router again and I will also create a new routes folder which you wouldn't

03:12.120 --> 03:18.480
have to do but this structure still make sense, separating routes and controllers,

03:18.480 --> 03:20.930
you just won't have views anymore,

03:21.000 --> 03:26.180
the views folder will not be recreated because we'll not render any views anymore,

03:26.190 --> 03:28.360
we'll just exchange data.

03:28.360 --> 03:30.010
So in the routes folder here,

03:30.150 --> 03:38.520
let's say we're building a simple block or a simple messaging social network block like application

03:38.730 --> 03:40.990
and we have some feed routes,

03:41.070 --> 03:47.430
so like the news feed or something like that where we simply are able to create new messages, show existing

03:47.430 --> 03:48.800
messages and so on.

03:49.020 --> 03:56.250
So I'll create a feed.js file in the routes folder and in there, we set up our express router by again

03:56.790 --> 04:02.550
importing express into this file too because we need something from that package in that file and then

04:02.550 --> 04:11.340
I create the router by calling express router as a function and I will export the router at the bottom.

04:11.860 --> 04:18.260
In-between we can now define some routes and I want to start very simple with a get route

04:18.380 --> 04:24.010
to let's say posts where I serve my posts later on,

04:24.090 --> 04:26.130
not right now but later on.

04:26.190 --> 04:34.380
So here I have my posts and of course I now need my logic that should execute when a request reaches this.

04:34.410 --> 04:41.140
Therefore I'll create a new folder, controllers and in there I'll add my feed.js file as well,

04:41.170 --> 04:44.730
so feed.js in controllers now. In there

04:44.800 --> 04:54.220
let me export a new function, get posts which of course and that also does not change gets a request,

04:54.490 --> 05:00.430
the response object and the next function it could call to let the next middleware take over and in there,

05:00.670 --> 05:04.860
I want to send a response and this will be the first part that gets interesting.

05:05.110 --> 05:13.480
Before we write that code, in my routes feed.js file, I will import my feed controller by requiring

05:13.480 --> 05:17.750
it from the controllers folder and there from the feed file

05:18.820 --> 05:25.490
and I will assign my feed controller get posts function here as the function that should be executed

05:25.490 --> 05:26.910
for this route.

05:27.860 --> 05:34.880
Now to be able to reach that route, we need to register the route in app.js which is our starting file.

05:35.270 --> 05:46.160
So in there, I will import my feed routes by requiring them from routes feed like this and then all we

05:46.160 --> 05:53.090
have to do here is we have to use these routes, used to forward any http method, we'll filter them out in

05:53.090 --> 05:56.660
the routes file then like with this get function here.

05:57.140 --> 06:05.780
So we forward any incoming request to feed route let's say or let's say we only forward requests that start

06:05.810 --> 06:07.450
with /feed, again

06:07.460 --> 06:09.940
this is logic you already learned about.

06:09.950 --> 06:15.400
So now any incoming request that starts with /feed will make it into feed routes,

06:15.470 --> 06:19.630
so into this file and there we handle one request right now,

06:19.700 --> 06:20.850
/posts.

06:20.990 --> 06:25.270
So in total, /feed/posts would be handled right now

06:25.310 --> 06:27.710
as long as it is a get request,

06:27.800 --> 06:32.400
this kind of request would get handled by this controller.

06:32.870 --> 06:40.120
And now let's talk about the response and how we could send a request to that route.
