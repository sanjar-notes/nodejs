00:02.330 --> 00:04.140
Now to work with SQL,

00:04.160 --> 00:10.640
we need a SQL based database and I'll go for MySQL because you can install and use that for free,

00:11.690 --> 00:15.100
at least in the basic version which does suffice for this course.

00:15.230 --> 00:19.870
You can visit MySQL.com to download and install it

00:20.180 --> 00:22.430
and there simply click on downloads

00:23.230 --> 00:24.070
and scroll down,

00:24.070 --> 00:26.100
we don't need the enterprise edition here

00:26.110 --> 00:32.010
instead we'll go for the community edition which is the free one, click on downloads there too

00:32.110 --> 00:39.940
and now what we will need is the MySQL community server and we'll also need the workbench.

00:39.970 --> 00:45.760
Now you can also download a combined installer, especially here for Windows you should choose the MySQL

00:45.760 --> 00:51.690
on Windows Installer in tools which allows you to set up everything in one go

00:51.850 --> 00:56.620
but you can also click on MySQL community server here simply and this should give you a download

00:56.620 --> 00:58.940
which allows you to install all these things in one go

00:58.940 --> 01:02.510
anyways. So let's choose the MySQL community server here,

01:02.860 --> 01:05.060
always dive into the installation instructions

01:05.080 --> 01:10.900
in case you're facing any problems on your system and then if you scroll down, select your operating

01:10.900 --> 01:13.950
system here, the one you plan on using,

01:14.140 --> 01:20.280
so for Windows you can then also download this general installer which allows you to pick the programs

01:20.320 --> 01:22.270
you need, for MacOS

01:22.270 --> 01:32.390
we simply can go for this first download, the DMG archive and then once you click there you don't have

01:32.390 --> 01:33.010
to log in,

01:33.020 --> 01:33.990
you can simply choose

01:33.980 --> 01:34.650
no thanks

01:34.640 --> 01:39.900
just start my download to well start the download.

01:39.930 --> 01:43.010
Now this can take a while because it's quite a big file,

01:43.130 --> 01:49.910
on Windows you have the choice between downloading a web-based installer which is smaller but downloads

01:49.940 --> 01:55.100
what you need to during the installation or a complete installer which downloads everything in advance.

01:55.460 --> 01:59.790
Once your download is done, simply execute the downloaded file

01:59.900 --> 02:01.290
so the windows installer

02:01.330 --> 02:05.700
or this Mac DMG archive. Here I'm asked

02:05.730 --> 02:09.310
to well continue through the installation wizard and I will do that,

02:09.320 --> 02:10.880
agree to the license,

02:10.880 --> 02:18.620
leave the default installation path, click on customize here though to choose what to install and make

02:18.620 --> 02:20.060
sure that you do install

02:20.130 --> 02:21.870
the MySQL server here.

02:22.160 --> 02:27.650
If you're running this installer on Windows, you should have a different installer where you can choose

02:27.650 --> 02:33.480
to install the MySQL server but then also in one go, install the

02:33.500 --> 02:35.360
MySQL workbench,

02:35.390 --> 02:41.110
so make sure you select both for installation and click install here

02:44.540 --> 02:46.800
and now on both operating systems,

02:46.830 --> 02:49.040
this should install it. Now

02:49.060 --> 02:55.940
once installation is done, a configuration process should start automatically. There

02:56.170 --> 03:02.830
you should make sure that during this configuration process, you do choose the legacy password encryption

03:02.890 --> 03:08.890
which sounds insecure but which is perfectly fine and the newer version simply is not supported

03:09.580 --> 03:12.410
by the node SQL package we're using yet.

03:12.460 --> 03:19.150
So choose the legacy password encryption and choose next, you also have to choose a password for your root

03:19.210 --> 03:22.170
user and you can also leave

03:22.200 --> 03:24.530
start MySQL server once installation is complete

03:24.730 --> 03:27.580
checked or check it if it is unchecked and click finish.

03:31.010 --> 03:31.620
On Windows,

03:31.640 --> 03:37.880
simply leave all the other settings as they are and click through them and by the end, it should be done and

03:37.880 --> 03:42.250
it should then also start a MySQL server for you

03:42.290 --> 03:47.770
with the setup you chose here in the configuration steps.

03:47.940 --> 03:55.830
Now once installation is complete, on Windows if you also installed the MySQL workbench, you're done, on Mac

03:55.890 --> 03:56.920
or Linux,

03:56.940 --> 03:58.380
you're not done yet,

03:58.380 --> 04:05.520
instead you should go back to your previous page where you chose MySQL community server and there also install

04:05.520 --> 04:06.990
the MySQL workbench.

04:07.110 --> 04:13.550
The workbench basically is a client, a visual client we can use to connect to our database to inspect

04:13.550 --> 04:18.930
it and play around with it outside of our node application which simply makes debugging and developing

04:18.930 --> 04:20.670
a bit easier.

04:20.710 --> 04:27.630
So choose the MySQL workbench here and there you also can choose your operating system,

04:27.640 --> 04:35.820
now again on Windows if you used that general installer, you already have it. Download that file here, again

04:35.820 --> 04:40.520
you don't need to log in, just start to download and wait for the download to finish

04:40.560 --> 04:44.190
so that you can again execute the, well executable

04:44.250 --> 04:49.540
once it is done. Finish the installation process as instructed

04:50.730 --> 04:55.870
by the installer and once you're done with that, you should be all good.

04:55.920 --> 05:03.980
You can now test your setup by starting the MySQL workbench you just installed and then there, you

05:03.980 --> 05:07.000
should already see your MySQL instance running.

05:07.100 --> 05:09.660
If that is not the case,

05:09.680 --> 05:17.120
have a look at the attached document where I describe some common issues or in general give you some

05:17.120 --> 05:21.610
links on how to make this work and how to bring this up,

05:21.620 --> 05:28.640
you just need to make sure that your MySQL server is running and during installation, you had a choice

05:28.640 --> 05:33.780
to check that it should always start with your system, on Mac

05:34.040 --> 05:39.620
you can also open your system preferences and there you should have the MySQL option where you can

05:39.620 --> 05:44.780
also stop and start the server. To connect to the database,

05:44.820 --> 05:52.080
simply click on that instance and now enter that root password you assigned during the installation.

05:52.090 --> 05:58.640
This should now allow you to connect to your SQL server instance like this,

05:58.700 --> 06:04.130
then once you enter the password you should be connected to your database system. And right now this is

06:04.160 --> 06:09.950
what you have, basically an empty window and we won't work too much in that, we'll of course work with

06:09.950 --> 06:12.610
our database from inside our node application

06:12.770 --> 06:18.350
but this will allow us to conveniently look into our database from time to time and see what is stored

06:18.470 --> 06:24.140
and one thing we can do already is we can go down to schemas here which can be translated with database

06:24.160 --> 06:24.500
here

06:24.560 --> 06:30.730
you could say and there, we can define a new schema, so a new database with which we'll work and I'll name it

06:30.770 --> 06:31.820
node complete,

06:31.850 --> 06:37.070
you can name this whatever you want and you can also leave the other settings here and then on the bottom

06:37.070 --> 06:38.530
right and I know it's small here,

06:38.530 --> 06:41.970
unfortunately you't zoom in,

06:41.980 --> 06:44.180
you can click apply. Now

06:44.200 --> 06:46.360
this will create a new database

06:46.360 --> 06:51.730
you can say with which we can interact later, you can leave all the default settings and simply click

06:51.760 --> 06:57.130
apply here and now you should see that node complete thing which has a couple of tables or none right

06:57.160 --> 07:03.980
now but where you can then later connect to and store your data in the tables that will be created here.

07:04.030 --> 07:11.530
So with that, we can continue and we can now move on with our code and start interacting with MySQL

07:11.540 --> 07:13.980
from inside our node application.
