00:02.120 --> 00:04.540
So now that we learned a lot about sessions,

00:04.540 --> 00:07.340
let me fix some things here real quick and

00:07.390 --> 00:13.810
for example if I go to my cart or to my orders, I have some issues there. And the problem of course is

00:14.080 --> 00:21.400
that without a valid session and we don't have a valid session now after destroying it, all these methods

00:21.480 --> 00:27.250
in there, all these actions where I do reach out to my user to fetch the current orders, these will all

00:27.250 --> 00:28.100
fail

00:28.240 --> 00:33.340
and of course this makes sense because we need a session because we need a user for that.

00:33.430 --> 00:38.560
So what would work are shop and products and there details,

00:38.580 --> 00:40.410
add to cart will not work though.

00:40.480 --> 00:46.720
So a first step to improving that besides checking for the existence of a user on the server which we

00:46.720 --> 00:49.450
will all add in the authentication module

00:49.480 --> 00:56.410
but a first thing we can do is that we adjust our frontend to only display things we can actually interact

00:56.410 --> 01:00.080
with based on our current authentication status.

01:00.160 --> 01:06.010
So for that, I'll go back to my views and I'll start with the navigation first of all because there we can

01:06.010 --> 01:12.700
also say that login and log out should only be displayed, should only be rendered when we are actually

01:12.700 --> 01:14.380
not logged in.

01:14.740 --> 01:21.260
So here I'm checking if we are authenticated to show add product and admin products,

01:21.340 --> 01:29.200
first of all this should move up and also include cart and orders because these only makes sense if

01:29.200 --> 01:32.570
we have a user because otherwise as we saw, we'll get an error

01:32.590 --> 01:39.100
if we visit these pages and then we can repeat the logic down there and only show this entire unordered

01:39.100 --> 01:39.490
list

01:39.550 --> 01:50.040
if we are not authenticated, so if this is not true then I want to show these items.

01:50.160 --> 01:57.150
So now we can also add this code and if we now save that and we reload this page, we only see shop and

01:57.150 --> 01:58.680
products by default,

01:58.740 --> 02:07.750
once I login though, we see the rest. Well actually log out should be visible once we are authenticated

02:07.750 --> 02:08.760
now that I think about it.

02:08.770 --> 02:15.980
So we should revert this, move that in there and only don't show this login list item

02:15.980 --> 02:19.900
if we are not authenticated, if we are authenticated

02:19.990 --> 02:29.160
so here we can use else, if we are authenticated then I of course want to show the log out screen.

02:29.680 --> 02:31.750
We get this correct here,

02:32.230 --> 02:35.670
so now here I can now close this.

02:35.680 --> 02:43.720
So now if I save that again and I reload my page here, I do see log out, once I click this, I see login and

02:43.720 --> 02:47.810
once I do login again, I see the inverse.

02:48.100 --> 02:50.020
And now also feel free to pause the video,

02:50.020 --> 02:51.680
make sure for add to cart

02:51.700 --> 02:52.750
the same is true,

02:52.800 --> 02:57.830
this should only be visible when you're logged in but not when we are logged out.

02:57.850 --> 03:02.570
Here's your chance to pause the video. Were you successful?

03:02.650 --> 03:09.850
It's actually the same logic because isAuthenticated is information we pass to every view anyways, so therefore we

03:09.850 --> 03:15.120
can go to the product list.ejs file where we do include Add to Cart,

03:15.130 --> 03:17.730
so we should go to add to cart actually and there,

03:17.750 --> 03:22.190
this entire view should only be rendered if we can add the item to the cart,

03:22.240 --> 03:29.140
so if we do have a session if we are authenticated. And therefore let's go back to the product list, this entire

03:29.140 --> 03:33.970
part here should only be rendered if we are authenticated,

03:34.030 --> 03:41.920
so if isAuthenticated is true then, we'll include this here otherwise as we won't.

03:41.920 --> 03:49.810
So now with this change if we save that, if I reload this page and I'm not logged in, I still see it because

03:49.900 --> 03:56.760
I'm on the wrong page. For products this will work but for the index page, this is a separate page,

03:56.870 --> 04:04.030
it's index.ejs, there we should also replace our include with that updated logic where we check for the

04:04.030 --> 04:08.680
existence of our, well logged in user.

04:08.680 --> 04:14.680
So now with this added to index.ejs too, now if I reload the starting page, this is only there

04:15.700 --> 04:22.190
after I logged in as you will see. Now we can add this to the cart and we fail again though,

04:22.240 --> 04:23.150
now why is that?

04:23.320 --> 04:25.280
Let's check this in the next lecture.
