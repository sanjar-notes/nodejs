00:02.470 --> 00:09.850
So let's edit the cart model now, we got the static add product method, now I need a new static method which is delete

00:09.970 --> 00:13.570
product. There I get an ID of the product I want to delete

00:17.480 --> 00:24.170
and I also want to get the price of that product, you can also name this product price because I'll need

00:24.170 --> 00:27.270
to update the total cart price of course.

00:27.400 --> 00:29.960
So with that, what do I need to do?

00:30.130 --> 00:37.990
Well first of all I need to get my cart, so I need to read my file here and copy that line

00:38.050 --> 00:39.820
and of course you could also refactor this

00:39.820 --> 00:44.750
for now I'll simply duplicate the code here to make it a bit easier to understand.

00:44.770 --> 00:46.220
So there I read my file,

00:46.240 --> 00:54.210
I try to read in the cart and if I got an error here, I can already return because that simply means

00:54.360 --> 00:56.030
somehow I didn't find a cart,

00:56.040 --> 01:00.000
so there certainly is nothing to delete right so I can just ignore this.

01:00.810 --> 01:02.070
Otherwise we will continue so

01:02.100 --> 01:04.210
if we get no error, we'll continue

01:04.230 --> 01:12.500
and now is the part where I want to update the cart. For this, I'll have my updated cart here and take

01:12.560 --> 01:17.120
all the properties of the old cart and put them into a new object with that spread

01:17.120 --> 01:23.330
operator, I now want to update both the products and the total price. The cart

01:23.330 --> 01:30.260
total price should be reduced by the product price, however this would be incorrect because if we have

01:30.260 --> 01:35.920
the product in the cart three times, it should be reduced by the product price times three.

01:36.170 --> 01:39.460
So let's postpone this for later, 

01:39.470 --> 01:46.760
let's first of all find out how often we do have the product in the cart. And for this I'll have my product

01:46.850 --> 01:55.140
index and I'll find the product in the updated cart in the products array with the find index method

01:55.520 --> 02:01.220
and there, this goes through all the products and I'll check for the product where the ID matches the

02:01.220 --> 02:02.170
ID of the product

02:02.180 --> 02:04.140
I tried to remove from the cart.

02:04.200 --> 02:06.270
This is now my index of the product,

02:06.320 --> 02:09.880
however here I could even find the product right away,

02:11.120 --> 02:17.180
just product like this because I will remove it differently from our products array.

02:17.210 --> 02:21.710
For now I just need the product to find out what the quantity is because remember, we're storing the

02:21.710 --> 02:23.820
quantity in that qty field,

02:25.720 --> 02:32.530
so const product qty equals product qty, you don't need to serve that in a separate constant,

02:32.650 --> 02:33.930
just a bit easier to read

02:34.150 --> 02:42.250
and now with that quantity, I can use that here to have the cart total price be my cart total price

02:42.250 --> 02:46.370
minus the product price I'm getting as an argument

02:46.420 --> 02:48.650
times product, whoops, 

02:48.910 --> 02:51.350
product quantity.

02:51.520 --> 02:54.370
So now I'll reduce the total price by the product price

02:54.370 --> 02:57.620
times how many times I had the product in the cart.

02:58.060 --> 03:00.640
So that is one important piece of information

03:00.640 --> 03:07.390
and now I can also update my cart products here, whoops, products and set it equal to,

03:10.050 --> 03:12.650
whoops not that cart by the way, the updated cart down there,

03:12.650 --> 03:20.140
so updated cart total price, updated cart total price and updated cart products is now updated cart

03:20.410 --> 03:28.390
products which for now is the old products array but now I'll call filter again just as I did in the product

03:28.390 --> 03:29.710
model, there

03:29.820 --> 03:34.920
this function runs over all elements in there and keeps only ones where I return true,

03:35.020 --> 03:39.100
so I want to return true for all products except for the one I'm removing,

03:39.100 --> 03:44.860
so here I will return true only if the product ID is not equal to the ID I'm looking for.

03:44.860 --> 03:47.000
So all other products are kept.

03:47.200 --> 03:56.310
And with that, I can write the cart back into my file by copying this, write file and store my updated cart

03:56.320 --> 03:56.750
there.

03:57.760 --> 03:59.830
So this should now in theory work,

03:59.830 --> 04:07.750
I can now also go to the product model and there I now need to import my cart model, so const cart equals

04:07.780 --> 04:12.150
require cart like this

04:12.300 --> 04:23.750
and now with that imported, in here I can simply call cart delete product and pass the ID and I also

04:23.750 --> 04:32.720
need the price now. To get this, I will extract my product before removing it so I'll have my product here

04:33.580 --> 04:39.850
by searching my products with the find method for the product where the ID matches the ID I try

04:39.850 --> 04:40.570
to delete,

04:40.690 --> 04:46.960
so now I got that product information here which allows me to pass in the product price to my delete product

04:47.070 --> 04:50.020
method.

04:50.060 --> 04:56.760
So now we are able hopefully to delete a product by its ID and also to then delete it from the cart

04:56.780 --> 04:58.370
if it was in there

04:58.370 --> 05:05.150
and right now for example, if we have a look at our cart, we do have that ID, the milk can,

05:05.150 --> 05:08.760
we do have that in there so this should be gone if we delete it.

05:08.810 --> 05:16.020
So now in the admin controller in post delete product, we can use product and then delete by id and pass

05:16.020 --> 05:20.850
in our prod ID here, like this

05:21.100 --> 05:26.050
and then we can also redirect to /admin/products.

05:26.050 --> 05:31.660
Now by the way a little side note, it would be best if we have a callback in delete by ID so that we

05:31.660 --> 05:33.730
only redirect once we're done

05:33.910 --> 05:35.950
and the same is also true for updating

05:35.950 --> 05:42.920
by the way. There the callback in save would be best for redirecting, for now I'll not do this, later

05:42.940 --> 05:49.250
we will add this little functionality. But let's now see if that works,

05:49.350 --> 05:56.640
if I delete the milk can here, I get an error, cart is not defined in my cart.js

05:56.650 --> 06:00.020
model, deleting the product work though,

06:00.060 --> 06:06.860
if you check products.json, you don't find it anymore so this worked but in the cart model, yeah

06:07.040 --> 06:12.920
I'm trying to get all cart fields but of course I'm looking at the file content so I should use this.

06:12.920 --> 06:17.150
This is a bit annoying because now I deleted the product whilst I still have it in the cart but

06:17.150 --> 06:18.200
it's no problem,

06:18.200 --> 06:26.360
I will simply recreate it and then hack the ID into the products.json file.

06:26.450 --> 06:31.190
So let's go to admin products, add a new product real quick, test,

06:31.190 --> 06:32.620
get that image again,

06:32.930 --> 06:34.020
set the same price

06:34.040 --> 06:39.520
so that I correctly update my my cart price here and remove the correct price

06:42.300 --> 06:44.130
and then some description test.

06:44.130 --> 06:46.290
So now this exists again.

06:46.440 --> 06:52.260
Now let's just make sure that I copy the ID that I have in a cart and replace the one that was newly generated

06:52.270 --> 06:59.200
in products.json so that we really well delete the correct one from the cart too. Save all of that

06:59.640 --> 07:00.980
and now let's give this a try,

07:00.990 --> 07:06.450
if I click delete, if I reload this first of all so that we load the new ID here too and I click delete,

07:08.580 --> 07:17.400
cannot read property, find of undefined is now the problem in the cart model. And that problem here is that

07:17.560 --> 07:19.740
of course is still a string json format

07:19.760 --> 07:23.940
so I need to parse it before using my file content.

07:23.960 --> 07:26.710
So let's save this, same problem as before,

07:29.090 --> 07:33.800
I will quickly re-add this, add some dummy text as an image, doesn't really matter,

07:33.800 --> 07:39.410
set the price, some dummy text here, wI will not see the image here because it is not a real link but that

07:39.410 --> 07:40.470
does not matter.

07:40.550 --> 07:47.150
Now before doing anything, let's go to products.json and again replace the newly created ID with the ID

07:47.180 --> 07:49.850
in the cart, like this,

07:49.850 --> 07:52.500
reload this admin products page and click delete

07:52.700 --> 07:54.230
and now this looks much better,

07:54.260 --> 08:00.400
now this seems to work and in the cart indeed, products is empty and the total price was reduced to zero.

08:00.770 --> 08:02.280
So this is working

08:02.450 --> 08:08.790
and now let's finish this module up by also making sure that we do display cart items on the cart view

08:08.810 --> 08:09.320
here.
