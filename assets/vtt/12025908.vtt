00:02.660 --> 00:05.920
That's it for this module, you learned a lot about files,

00:05.950 --> 00:12.280
you learned how to add file upload functionality, both in the form and then most importantly on the

00:12.280 --> 00:19.480
backend by using multer, this nice middleware which automatically extracts files from incoming requests

00:19.540 --> 00:26.300
and stores them as specified by us and which also is able to filter out certain file types if we want

00:26.310 --> 00:26.960
to.

00:27.120 --> 00:32.230
You learned how to store files, both for adding and editing items,

00:32.230 --> 00:39.490
so how to manage that and you of course also learned how to download files, how to serve them statically

00:39.670 --> 00:45.040
with the help of that static middleware expressjs ships with and how to make sure that this uses

00:45.040 --> 00:46.430
the right path

00:46.430 --> 00:53.620
and alternatively or depending on your requirements, how you can serve files as a response in a route,

00:53.950 --> 01:01.090
like with get order here in the shop.js controller where we saw multiple different options of serving

01:01.180 --> 01:06.140
a file that already existed, for example by loading it into memory and then returning it

01:06.430 --> 01:09.760
or that you could stream such a file instead

01:10.000 --> 01:16.570
or that you can even generate files on the fly if required, depending on what your application requirements

01:16.630 --> 01:23.230
are. With that you learned a lot of things about how to work with files, with streams, with responses and

01:23.230 --> 01:28.890
this hopefully helps you implement file related features into your next application.
