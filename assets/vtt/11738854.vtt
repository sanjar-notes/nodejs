00:02.490 --> 00:09.290
Let's start in the use folder and let's start with our product list.ejs file. There

00:09.360 --> 00:16.340
we obviously also want to be able to view the details for a given product when we click on it.

00:16.350 --> 00:18.510
Now this requires a couple of adjustments,

00:18.630 --> 00:23.830
first of all we got our entire article here which holds our product information,

00:23.880 --> 00:30.300
so this product cart and we now need a way to also load a detail page. For this

00:30.300 --> 00:36.620
I will go into my cart actions down there and add a new button there which is actually an anchor tag,

00:36.690 --> 00:39.690
I'll just give it the class button to make it look like one

00:39.930 --> 00:45.960
and there I'll add details or write details on it and this should go to some details page,

00:45.990 --> 00:48.320
we'll continue working on this part in a second.

00:48.630 --> 00:54.330
Let's now reload that products page here and you should see that details button there.

00:54.390 --> 01:00.840
Now details should of course not lead to just slash but to a page that does show us some details for

01:00.850 --> 01:01.970
the given product

01:02.010 --> 01:07.740
and this is exactly one of the use cases where we need to pass additional information as part of our

01:07.740 --> 01:16.010
path because let's say we want to load /products and then /information for this specific product,

01:16.020 --> 01:18.720
now for that, we need some unique identifier.

01:18.960 --> 01:24.390
So first of all, let's ensure that every product we create actually has a unique ID and for that, I'll

01:24.390 --> 01:29.610
go into my model product.js and in there we don't assign an ID yet,

01:29.670 --> 01:37.710
so when we create a new product here or when we save it to the database so to say, so to a file, in one

01:37.710 --> 01:44.250
of these steps we should also add an ID and I will do it in save. Right before we do save it to a file,

01:44.520 --> 01:46.000
I'll add a new property

01:45.990 --> 01:47.760
by writing this ID

01:47.910 --> 01:52.230
and this adds a new property to the entire product object we're working on

01:52.530 --> 01:54.180
and I'll set it equal to

01:54.300 --> 01:55.890
and now we need some unique ID.

01:56.010 --> 02:00.970
Well we can generate a real unique ID with some external packages or anything like this,

02:01.110 --> 02:08.310
for now I will simply take math random which theoretically is not guaranteed to be unique of course

02:08.400 --> 02:13.860
but here as a dummy value it'll do. So math random is now my unique ID,

02:14.910 --> 02:18.090
I'll convert it to a string to have a text unique ID,

02:18.090 --> 02:22.710
you could use a number but I'll go with a string and therefore this will now be saved for all new

02:22.710 --> 02:23.790
products too,

02:23.840 --> 02:29.460
so our products will now have an ID. And now that we know that, back in product list.ejs,

02:29.720 --> 02:34.080
I want to pass that unique ID to my path here.

02:34.590 --> 02:42.090
So I will now use ejs here to also output something as part of that link here, as part of this path

02:42.510 --> 02:45.010
and that will be product.ID,

02:45.180 --> 02:51.480
we have that ID available now. So this link will now lead to products and now let's say we had this

02:51.480 --> 02:52.770
random value,

02:52.770 --> 02:55.370
this would be one possible path

02:55.380 --> 03:02.400
now. Now we just want to make sure that we of course then also are able to handle that and extract

03:02.430 --> 03:07.440
that unique ID from the path in our routes file

03:07.530 --> 03:08.150
so that we

03:08.160 --> 03:13.790
or in the controller, so that we can load the correct product and show the details for it

03:13.890 --> 03:15.680
and that is the whole idea here.

03:15.720 --> 03:21.270
We send some information as part of the path so that we can extract all the data we need for the product

03:21.720 --> 03:28.170
from the controller or inside of the controller because we can't really send the entire product as part

03:28.170 --> 03:28.950
of the url

03:29.100 --> 03:32.780
but we can send this key information.

03:33.030 --> 03:39.340
Now with that, let's go to the data folder and make sure to remove all products you have in there and

03:39.360 --> 03:45.270
I'll just quickly save that link here so that I don't have to search a new image but then make sure

03:45.270 --> 03:52.770
to remove that or even easier, add an ID by adding ID between double quotation marks and give that some

03:53.010 --> 03:55.360
random number.

03:55.390 --> 03:59.450
Theoretically you can use any string but I'll go for some random number.

03:59.480 --> 04:02.950
And now we have that ID added and therefore our code will now work,

04:03.010 --> 04:07.990
if we didn't add this well we would not find an ID and therefore we could not create that path that

04:07.990 --> 04:09.420
contains the ID.

04:09.580 --> 04:16.560
If you save that and reload, if you hover over details now or if we click on it, you should see that in the

04:16.690 --> 04:17.240
url

04:17.260 --> 04:22.540
you now also have that ID in there and right now we got a page not found because we're not handling

04:22.540 --> 04:27.580
this route yet but we have products and then this ID and in a next step,

04:27.580 --> 04:32.080
we will now extract that ID and then know which product to load.
