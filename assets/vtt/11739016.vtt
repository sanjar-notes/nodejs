00:02.170 --> 00:05.140
Time to retrieve a single book when we click on details,

00:05.170 --> 00:10.720
so essentially I'm talking about the get product action here in my controller.

00:10.720 --> 00:12.220
We get the product ID here

00:12.550 --> 00:17.470
and indeed this is the old find by ID method I defined

00:17.470 --> 00:24.980
but if we were to delete it, we see that sequelize also has a find by ID method.

00:25.000 --> 00:31.750
So actually if I leave this code exactly as it is right here at least, it will work, one difference is that

00:31.810 --> 00:32.980
with sequelize,

00:33.010 --> 00:35.890
we don't get an array of products here

00:36.010 --> 00:40.980
instead I get a single product so I can just use it like this.

00:40.990 --> 00:46.720
So with these tiny changes, turning this into a single product and using it as such and leaving this as it

00:46.720 --> 00:55.330
is actually, I should already be able to view the details and I am, just the images may be a bit oversized

00:55.330 --> 00:56.270
here,

00:56.360 --> 00:59.450
that is something we can quickly fix in css. 

00:59.710 --> 01:06.160
I quickly added the image class to the div wrapping my product in the product detail view here and

01:06.160 --> 01:11.830
now in the main.css file where I also have my centered class,

01:11.970 --> 01:22.850
I will add a new image class and restrict the max height to let's say 20rem and then also say that

01:22.940 --> 01:31.550
any image text in the, nested in an element with the image class should respect that height and that

01:31.560 --> 01:34.970
should also be just height not max height.

01:35.230 --> 01:37.400
And with that if I now reload this page here,

01:37.410 --> 01:42.580
this is looking better and we should have no problems with the image anymore.

01:42.960 --> 01:47.790
Just a tiny change, the main takeaway of course is we can retrieve the product like this.

01:47.790 --> 01:52.310
However I also want to show you an alternative way,

01:52.490 --> 01:59.780
so using this syntax here is perfectly fine but let me also show you how we can use the normal find method

01:59.780 --> 02:03.680
we also got, find all to be precise.

02:03.920 --> 02:08.570
We only have one product with that ID of course but I want to show you that where syntax,

02:08.570 --> 02:10.560
so any object we can pass to find all,

02:10.600 --> 02:12.090
I'll set the where key

02:12.320 --> 02:15.500
and there you got a rich query language

02:15.500 --> 02:19.840
or a rich amount of options you can use to configure this.

02:19.970 --> 02:23.300
More can of course be found in the official tutorial,

02:23.300 --> 02:28.590
if you go to querying there, there you'll find all the details about how to configure your queries,

02:28.610 --> 02:32.030
for example you can also control which attributes are retrieved,

02:32.030 --> 02:34.560
you don't have to get all attributes all the time,

02:34.640 --> 02:40.700
if you only need the title, you can define this too and you'll also see how to use where. How to use it in a basic

02:40.700 --> 02:46.490
form, where you want to simply check that one attribute has one exact value but also how you can use

02:46.790 --> 02:53.660
operators to have alternative conditions or to check if something is greater than or greater than equal

02:54.350 --> 02:57.400
or lower than a value and so on.

02:57.410 --> 03:01.140
So you got a lot of options there and definitely check out these docs,

03:01.280 --> 03:08.750
here we could say I'm looking for all products where the ID is equal to prod ID and then I will use

03:08.750 --> 03:11.560
them or catch any errors.

03:11.840 --> 03:15.140
Now the one important thing here of course is by default

03:15.200 --> 03:21.470
this gives us an array because even though we know that only one product will have this ID, find all

03:21.590 --> 03:27.730
per definition always gives you multiple items even if it's an array with only one element.

03:27.770 --> 03:34.590
So if we use this syntax and we render this, we'll have products and we're interested in the first product,

03:34.640 --> 03:37.330
in this case also the only product as we know.

03:37.460 --> 03:43.880
So now I can comment out the other approach and if we save that and we go back to our application and

03:43.880 --> 03:49.220
we reload that detail page, it looks like it works but actually this keeps on loading

03:49.220 --> 03:52.090
so something went wrong and indeed

03:52.190 --> 03:53.770
we got an error here,

03:55.610 --> 03:57.730
product is not defined. Yeah

03:57.850 --> 04:02.110
here for the title I should also use products zero of course.

04:02.210 --> 04:08.870
So now with that if we save that and let it restart therefore, now we can reload this page and it works as

04:08.870 --> 04:15.590
before but now is using find where, find all with that where query and I simply wanted to show you

04:15.590 --> 04:17.300
this alternative approach.

04:17.300 --> 04:22.490
Of course it's perfectly fine and even preferrable in this case to use find by ID,

04:22.700 --> 04:26.480
so I will actually switch back to that other approach.

04:26.480 --> 04:28.370
It's good to know how you can query though.
