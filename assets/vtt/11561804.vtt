Welcome onboard of this course, I'm extremely excited to have you as a student in this course.

00:08.080 --> 00:09.550
This course is all about

00:09.550 --> 00:10.580
nodejs,

00:10.690 --> 00:15.020
one of the most exciting server side technologies you can learn these days.

00:15.220 --> 00:20.980
And in this course, we'll not just dive into its basics, though we will also do that but we'll dive into

00:20.980 --> 00:28.390
exciting topics like handling file uploads, pagination, working with different databases, SQL and

00:28.390 --> 00:36.040
NoSQL databases for example, building an app where we render views, dynamic html on the server

00:36.250 --> 00:43.720
and building restful and even graphQL APIs, working with real time data and web sockets and much

00:43.840 --> 00:48.660
much more as you will see in the outline which will come later in this module.

00:48.670 --> 00:54.040
There is a lot of content in this course and it definitely is no short course but it will take you from

00:54.050 --> 00:55.630
zero to advanced

00:55.630 --> 01:01.750
nodejs developer and by the end of this course, you will have all the knowledge you need to dive deeper

01:01.750 --> 01:04.860
into advanced topics and start building your own.

01:04.870 --> 01:10.030
nodejs projects and applications of course. And we'll not just learn all of that

01:10.030 --> 01:13.580
in theory, we will build real projects in this course.

01:13.630 --> 01:19.120
We will build an entire online shop including checkout and payment with stripejs,

01:19.180 --> 01:24.680
so there's a lot of content to cover and I'm really excited to dive into it together with you.

01:24.730 --> 01:25.930
Now who am I?

01:25.930 --> 01:31.810
My name is Maximillian Schwarzmuller and I'm a freelance web developer as well as five star rated instructors

01:31.840 --> 01:33.110
here on Udemy.

01:33.130 --> 01:38.850
I've got multiple best-selling courses and nodejs is a topic that was missing thus far,

01:39.010 --> 01:43.080
well it isn't anymore and I had a lot of fun creating this course,

01:43.090 --> 01:46.480
I hope you have equally much fun and you'll learn a lot

01:46.570 --> 01:52.110
whilst going through the course. So let's dive in and let's start with the most important question,

01:52.180 --> 01:53.470
what is nodejs?
