Now with the pagination added to this first page, let's add it to the products page here as well.

00:09.860 --> 00:17.250
And to do that, we can of course grab this entire section either from the index.ejs file, cut it and

00:17.250 --> 00:24.330
create a new include for it which we can name pagination.ejs and in there, I'll insert this pagination

00:24.330 --> 00:33.910
content and in index.ejs where I had this previously, I can copy that include code from add to

00:33.910 --> 00:39.570
cart and add it here and include not add to cart but pagination of course

00:39.760 --> 00:47.110
and I just need to forward the data into pagination, so current page, previous page, next page, has next

00:47.110 --> 00:50.280
page, has previous page, all that data should be forwarded.

00:52.440 --> 00:58.390
So I want to forward current page, which value is current page,

00:58.390 --> 01:07.220
so the key value pairs here need to be equal. Next page which is next page, previous page which value is,

01:07.910 --> 01:16.340
whoops. previous page, last page where the value is last page, has next page where you guessed it, the value

01:16.350 --> 01:27.650
is has next page and and has previous page where the value is has previous page.

01:27.680 --> 01:32.380
Now with that include added, let's quickly test this by going back to the index page,

01:34.160 --> 01:44.580
that all seems to work and now we can grab that include code and add it also on the product list page.

01:45.020 --> 01:45.770
There

01:47.840 --> 01:53.430
we load this div, I can add my include to add the pagination section too.

01:53.480 --> 02:01.370
So now if we save that, we also need to adjust our controller because there in get index,

02:01.400 --> 02:03.710
I have all the logic for paginating,

02:03.830 --> 02:10.100
I need that same logic in get products. And again, you could refactor this because now we're sharing a

02:10.100 --> 02:11.020
lot of code

02:11.240 --> 02:13.790
but I will copy that entire code here

02:15.040 --> 02:18.960
where I get my products, get the count, skip and limit and so on, so

02:18.970 --> 02:26.260
I will copy all of that and replace my logic and get products up there with it, just render something

02:26.260 --> 02:27.200
different,

02:27.310 --> 02:33.510
the product list view here, name this products maybe and the rest should be equal.

02:33.580 --> 02:43.100
And now if we save all that and I go to products, I should update the path here too, to products so that the right

02:43.220 --> 02:45.260
item gets marked in the navigation.

02:45.440 --> 02:52.550
So now if I reload this page, products is highlighted and now here I also have a working pagination

02:52.550 --> 02:53.590
in place.

02:53.750 --> 02:59.240
Now there is a tiny error I need to fix because right now if we're on the products page here and we

02:59.240 --> 03:05.930
paginate around, I actually load my index page again because in the pagination.ejs file here, I

03:05.930 --> 03:09.970
always have this absolute path, slash and then the query parameter.

03:09.980 --> 03:15.710
Well I should only have the query parameter so that this gets appended to whatever the current url

03:15.720 --> 03:21.740
and path is and this will make sure that if I am on /products, I stay there and if I'm on slash

03:21.770 --> 03:23.390
nothing, I stay there.

03:23.660 --> 03:28.840
So if I reload slash nothing, you see the pagination query parameter still gets appended

03:29.030 --> 03:35.510
but if I'm on products, it gets appended there and I stay on /products which of course is the behavior

03:35.600 --> 03:36.370
I want here and

03:36.640 --> 03:38.210
with that, this is fixed.
