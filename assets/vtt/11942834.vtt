00:02.090 --> 00:05.440
We're nearing the end, let's make sure we can also delete cart items

00:05.440 --> 00:10.980
now. For this I'll first of all get rid of that code I previously had for updating the cart,

00:11.000 --> 00:14.070
we outsourced this into our cart model for now

00:14.300 --> 00:19.580
and now let's work on the post cart delete product action here in the shop controller.

00:19.580 --> 00:25.850
I of course want to be able to delete items from the cart and to delete items from the cart,

00:25.910 --> 00:29.740
the user model is again a great place to work on. There

00:29.820 --> 00:31.440
I'll add a new method,

00:31.910 --> 00:33.950
delete item from cart,

00:33.980 --> 00:40.430
the name is up to you and I only need the product ID here to remove the entire product from the cart.

00:41.270 --> 00:43.580
With that ID passed,

00:43.660 --> 00:51.800
we can create a new constant, updated cart items and first of all copy all existing cart items,

00:51.810 --> 00:59.730
again with this spread operator. However we can even take an easier route and just use this cart items

01:00.120 --> 01:01.860
and then the built in filter method,

01:01.860 --> 01:08.970
this is again a method provided by vanilla javascript. Filter allows us to define a criteria on how

01:08.970 --> 01:10.970
we want to filter the elements in that array,

01:11.010 --> 01:17.220
so in this case the elements of the items array and then it will return a new array with all the filtered

01:17.220 --> 01:22.920
items, so all the items that make it through the filter. The filter is a function here which runs on every

01:22.920 --> 01:25.300
item and then we return true

01:25.320 --> 01:27.630
if we want to keep the item in the new array

01:27.660 --> 01:28.440
or false

01:28.440 --> 01:29.810
if you want to get rid of it.

01:30.120 --> 01:35.020
Now I want to keep all items except for the item which we're deleting,

01:35.220 --> 01:42.600
so I will look into each item and these cart items are objects of the structure we define up here,

01:42.600 --> 01:47.400
they are objects with a product ID and a quantity. So I'm looking for the product ID now,

01:48.920 --> 01:58.290
down there I'm looking for the product ID and if that is equal to the product ID I'm getting here, then I

01:58.290 --> 01:59.190
know this is element

01:59.220 --> 02:05.670
I want to remove, so I'll check for the opposite because remember, I return true here if I want to keep the

02:05.670 --> 02:06.170
item,

02:06.190 --> 02:08.820
so I want to return false if I want to get rid of it.

02:08.880 --> 02:10.380
So this should return false

02:10.470 --> 02:17.420
if I want to get rid of it and I want to get rid of it for this condition. As before with toString,

02:17.440 --> 02:21.150
we can guarantee we're working with the right type of data here

02:21.490 --> 02:26.740
and now we have the updated cart items which we just need to save back to our cart and therefore to

02:26.740 --> 02:32.360
the database because these is already are the cart items with the one item we wanted to get rid of removed.

02:33.320 --> 02:41.310
So I can simply copy my code from up there where I update the database, like this and when I say updated

02:41.430 --> 02:47.070
cart here, well I simply mean I want to assign this to an object with an items property because that is

02:47.070 --> 02:48.820
what our cart has, right,

02:48.840 --> 02:58.160
we have items in there and items is equal to our updated cart items and that is it. This now will update

02:58.250 --> 03:03.210
the cart to have all cart items except for the one we deleted.

03:03.230 --> 03:10.890
So back in the shop.js controller, here I don't need to call get cart instead on the user,

03:11.000 --> 03:16.610
I can call my new method, delete item from cart which you just added,

03:16.940 --> 03:23.450
we can call that here and pass the product ID as an argument and that we can get rid of all that code

03:24.170 --> 03:25.270
and simply redirect

03:25.280 --> 03:28.740
once we're done, so let's see if that works.

03:29.050 --> 03:37.750
If we now save this, let's go to the routes and add this post route for deleting cart items, reload this

03:37.750 --> 03:42.730
page here and let's delete the second item and this is looking good.

03:42.770 --> 03:43.970
It's gone here,

03:44.480 --> 03:46.240
no errors here

03:46.280 --> 03:47.430
so this is looking good

03:47.650 --> 03:53.600
and if I update this in compass, we see that for this user we indeed

03:53.750 --> 03:59.480
well obviously only have the other items. So this worked and that is how we can delete cart items with

03:59.500 --> 03:59.810
these.
