00:02.180 --> 00:04.820
So what is express and why do we use it?

00:04.910 --> 00:06.680
Well I briefly mentioned it,

00:06.890 --> 00:10.480
writing all that server side logic is pretty complex,

00:10.490 --> 00:17.450
just remember what we had to do to parse an incoming request. For extracting the body, we manually had

00:17.450 --> 00:23.970
to listen to the data event, to the end event and then create a buffer which we in the end converted to a string

00:24.110 --> 00:30.710
and this was just one type of data we could get. If we get other kinds of data, like for example we get

00:30.740 --> 00:36.940
a file or differently structured data, then we would have to write new logic. Now expressjs

00:36.950 --> 00:38.190
helps us with that,

00:38.240 --> 00:44.420
it actually doesn't have a built-in way of handling or parsing that data but it makes it easy to

00:44.420 --> 00:51.170
install another package that can easily be hooked into our project that will then do the parsing for

00:51.170 --> 00:53.820
us and you will see what I mean in a second.

00:53.840 --> 00:57.890
We in general don't want to care about all these nitty gritty details,

00:57.920 --> 01:02.390
we want to focus on our code that defines our application,

01:02.390 --> 01:08.570
so the thing that really sets our application apart from other applications, our unique selling point

01:08.570 --> 01:15.200
you could say and we do use a framework for this, for all the heavy lifting. A framework is basically

01:15.200 --> 01:22.780
a set of helper functions but also a suite of tools and rules with which we work,

01:22.910 --> 01:29.720
so basically we have a clearly defined way or at least some outline on how we should structure our application,

01:29.720 --> 01:34.580
our code and how we should work with that framework to write clean code

01:34.580 --> 01:39.590
and of course, I will teach you all of that for expressjs in this module.

01:39.770 --> 01:42.540
So expressjs helps us with that

01:42.620 --> 01:44.980
and this is why we will dive into it here.

01:45.050 --> 01:52.400
Now of course expressjs is not the only package or framework you can use for nodejs that will help

01:52.400 --> 01:56.660
you write better nodejs code and focus on your business logic.

01:56.900 --> 02:00.040
Now from one you could of course stick to vanilla nodejs,

02:00.050 --> 02:06.950
we only use that thus far and of course that works and depending on the complexity of your application

02:07.160 --> 02:11.550
or the level of challenges you are seeking, you can absolutely stick to vanilla

02:11.560 --> 02:17.710
nodejs, you can theoretically write everything on your own just with that.

02:17.720 --> 02:20.450
There also are other frameworks you could use,

02:20.450 --> 02:22.830
for example there is adonis.js.

02:22.970 --> 02:26.190
Now if you ever used laravel for php,

02:26.510 --> 02:30.920
this is basically a laravel inspired framework for nodejs

02:31.010 --> 02:38.890
but not from the same creators. There also is koa or a sailsjs and there are many more,

02:38.930 --> 02:45.350
you can basically Google for expressjs alternatives and you will find plenty of blogposts diving

02:45.350 --> 02:49.420
into the different alternatives and what their strengths and weaknesses are.

02:49.700 --> 02:54.830
But expressjs is by far the most popular and most often used one

02:54.890 --> 02:57.120
which is why I will also teach it here.

02:57.320 --> 03:04.490
The great thing about express is that it's highly flexible and actually doesn't add too much functionalities

03:04.520 --> 03:11.900
out of the box but it gives you a certain way of building your application or of working with the

03:11.900 --> 03:18.920
incoming requests that make it highly extensible and therefore, there are dozens or hundreds and thousands

03:19.130 --> 03:26.540
of third party packages built for express specifically that you can then easily add to your node express

03:26.540 --> 03:30.310
application without having to configure a lot and this is

03:30.320 --> 03:37.670
probably the real strength of express and of course it also does add some nice features out of the box.

03:37.670 --> 03:41.630
So why don't we just install it and take a closer look ourselves.
