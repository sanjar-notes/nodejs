00:02.320 --> 00:09.550
Now you could spend hours working on this application to add all the functionalities we need, to add

00:09.550 --> 00:18.500
products to a cart or to also interact with users, with orders and we can do all of that with these SQL

00:18.520 --> 00:18.990
queries

00:18.990 --> 00:20.570
we're already writing here.

00:20.590 --> 00:26.700
The problem is the queries will get more and more complex the more complex our application logic becomes

00:26.860 --> 00:32.650
and at some point, we'll have to connect tables because one thing we're not using right now are relations

00:32.800 --> 00:34.590
because we only got one table.

00:34.960 --> 00:41.170
Now we can do all of that just with the MySQL package and if you're a MySQL or a SQL master in general,

00:41.470 --> 00:45.250
you can definitely do that. For the rest of us,

00:45.280 --> 00:51.850
there is a way easier approach to that which allows us to not write all these queries, we don't have

00:51.850 --> 00:59.010
to write any SQL code but instead only work with native javascript objects that give us certain functionalities

00:59.020 --> 01:03.930
we need for connecting them, deleting them, adding them and so on. We'll use

01:03.950 --> 01:09.750
another third party package we can add to this application that makes our life a bunch easier.

01:09.760 --> 01:15.340
I just wanted to show you how you generally can add SQL and write your own queries, as a next step

01:15.390 --> 01:17.290
we'll not write our own queries,

01:17.340 --> 01:22.570
instead we'll find an easier approach in the next module with sequelize.
