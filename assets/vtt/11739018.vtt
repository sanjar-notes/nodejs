Now let's work on the admin products page because there, I also want to display my products so that

00:08.710 --> 00:10.440
we can interact with them.

00:10.480 --> 00:11.210
So in admin.js

00:11.210 --> 00:12.350
again,

00:12.580 --> 00:15.560
get product still uses fetch all, now

00:15.660 --> 00:20.280
it's of course a good practice for you to make this work with sequelize.

00:20.350 --> 00:26.110
So definitely pause the video at this point and try to change this code here such that it does retrieve

00:26.110 --> 00:29.300
the products and render them on the admin page.

00:31.500 --> 00:32.830
Were you successful?

00:33.210 --> 00:37.030
Well the code to you is of course the same code we used in the shop.js,

00:37.060 --> 00:41.030
instead of fetch all, we'll use find all

00:41.240 --> 00:46.680
and we don't use the callback function approach here because we're not using a callback function with

00:46.830 --> 00:47.800
sequelize,

00:47.850 --> 00:52.200
instead we have then and catch since we're using promises.

00:52.200 --> 01:00.300
So let's console log our error in this case or pass our function we used as a callback before to then and

01:00.300 --> 01:06.700
now here, we have our render function where we render the products. Therefore if I now reload this

01:06.750 --> 01:12.480
admin page, I see my product here and I can now add it or delete it.

01:12.570 --> 01:17.340
These however are two things that don't work, added doesn't work because I don't load the product

01:17.340 --> 01:20.350
successfully and delete wouldn't work either.

01:20.370 --> 01:23.310
So in the next lectures, we'll work on these two things.
