00:02.350 --> 00:06.610
In the last module, we continued working on our application

00:06.770 --> 00:11.960
but now we need the ability to pass some dynamic data through our routes.

00:11.990 --> 00:17.870
We want to be able to encode some information in our url so that we can for example pass a product

00:17.870 --> 00:25.980
ID as part of the url. In this module, you will learn how you can do that, how you can actually submit

00:26.010 --> 00:27.110
or send data

00:27.130 --> 00:33.980
through the url and when you would not do that and put it into the request body instead and we'll also

00:33.980 --> 00:40.670
continue working on our models, to be precise you will learn about how to pass route params, route parameters

00:41.210 --> 00:43.050
and how to use query parameters,

00:43.130 --> 00:46.380
both important things that the express router supports.

00:46.610 --> 00:53.060
But besides that we'll not just pass that information, in this module we'll also use it to enhance our

00:53.060 --> 00:53.760
models

00:53.780 --> 00:59.030
and with that I mean will add more functionalities, we'll even add a new model.

00:59.030 --> 01:04.670
So with that, let's start and let's learn how we can pass data and how we can use that data then.
