00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:05.140
<v Narrator>As mentioned, when you're working with Node,</v>

2
00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:08.210
you have these core Node modules here.

3
00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:12.020
for example, a module for working with the file system.

4
00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:15.340
and with Node, you simply import such a module,

5
00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:20.200
and then you can start reading or writing files for example.

6
00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:24.100
As you learned in the modern Java script with Node module,

7
00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:27.780
you also have a promise based API version available

8
00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:30.560
for some of these core modules.

9
00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:33.880
Now for Deno, we have a similar concept.

10
00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:37.963
There we have this so-called runtime API here,

11
00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:42.590
also sometimes called the namespace APIs.

12
00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:46.570
These are core APIs, core features,

13
00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:48.800
which are built into Deno,

14
00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:52.760
and which are available on a Deno object,

15
00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:55.750
which in turn is globally available

16
00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:58.970
in any Deno code you're executing.

17
00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:02.810
And here you got core modules for working with files,

18
00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:05.170
for working with requests.

19
00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:09.270
You also got core features like set timeouts,

20
00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.920
set interval, clear timeout.

21
00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:14.060
You have to fetch API available

22
00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:15.970
for sending network requests.

23
00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:17.650
And that actually by the way,

24
00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:20.830
is a difference compared to Node already.

25
00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:21.690
In Node,

26
00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:25.610
You also have some core APIs available,

27
00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:27.760
some core features available,

28
00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:32.510
either after importing them from the respective core module,

29
00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:34.750
or things like set timeout

30
00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:38.070
also are globally available in Node scripts,

31
00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:42.700
but things like the fetch API are not available in Node

32
00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:45.400
because Deno has the core philosophy

33
00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:49.120
of being as browser compatible as possible.

34
00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:53.150
That means that any code that could run outside of a browser

35
00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:55.230
is also supported in Deno.

36
00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:59.570
Something like the fetch API for sending HTTP requests.

37
00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:01.530
This is a available in Deno

38
00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.780
because this is not strictly tied to a browser.

39
00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:08.190
Of course we can send a fetch request at HTTP requests

40
00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:10.590
from any Java script.

41
00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.890
Now, of course, there also are other features,

42
00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:15.500
for example, related to writing files,

43
00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:17.010
which exist in Deno

44
00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:19.560
because Deno runs out sort of a browser,

45
00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:22.860
but which wouldn't exist inside of a browser.

46
00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:25.870
And there are features which we can use in a browser,

47
00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:29.800
for example, features to interact with the browser Dom,

48
00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:32.480
which are not supported in Deno.

49
00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:34.980
Also not supported in Node of course,

50
00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:37.180
because there we have no Dom

51
00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:39.880
there we are not running inside of a browser.

52
00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:42.660
So that's how you can think about these core APIs.

53
00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:46.520
It's basically what you can do in the browser minus

54
00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:49.330
features that only makes sense in the browser

55
00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:53.160
plus features that can't be used inside of the browser

56
00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:55.340
that can be used outside of it though.

57
00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:57.890
Something like writing files.

58
00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:01.310
And with that, I say, we talked about this enough,

59
00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:03.600
let's now write some Deno code,

60
00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:05.500
and let's see how we can utilize

61
00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:08.040
these built-in core features.

62
00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:10.983
These namespace API features.
