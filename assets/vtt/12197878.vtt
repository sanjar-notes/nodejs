Welcome to this module, the best things always come at the end.

00:05.660 --> 00:11.100
In this module I want to dive into an exciting piece of technology with you, we'll dive into graphql,

00:11.150 --> 00:17.420
an alternative to building a restful API that you would use in the same scenarios,

00:17.420 --> 00:25.010
so when you have a decoupled frontend and backend, you will not render views with a graphql API too but

00:25.010 --> 00:28.350
it provides some significant advantages over rest

00:28.350 --> 00:31.510
APIs, at least in certain scenarios.

00:31.550 --> 00:38.790
So in this module, we'll explore what graphql actually is and how it compares to rest APIs and

00:38.790 --> 00:45.770
you will learn how to use graphql of course, we'll actually take our existing project and turn it into

00:45.770 --> 00:49.830
a graphql API or use a graphql API.

00:50.090 --> 00:51.640
A very exciting technology,

00:51.710 --> 00:53.670
I'm super excited to get started with it,

00:53.750 --> 00:54.680
so let's dive in.
