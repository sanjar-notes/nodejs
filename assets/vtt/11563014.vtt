In the last lectures we worked a bit on the project setup and how we could use external packages which

00:08.170 --> 00:11.430
is super important and which we'll do a lot throughout this course.

00:11.620 --> 00:16.120
But now I want to have a look at something else which helps us during development and that is of course

00:16.460 --> 00:17.430
fixing errors,

00:17.440 --> 00:23.830
we need to understand how we can find and fix errors in our code because there always will be errors,

00:24.010 --> 00:27.600
you will never write a program that just runs perfectly.

00:27.670 --> 00:33.550
For this, we first of all have to understand that there are different types of errors so that you can

00:33.550 --> 00:36.830
understand how each type can be tackled.

00:36.910 --> 00:42.990
The first kind of error you often get or you sometimes getting your programs are a syntax error,

00:43.180 --> 00:49.810
this is if you have a typo in your code or you forget like a closing curly brace or anything like

00:49.810 --> 00:50.430
that,

00:50.500 --> 00:56.490
so you have an error which should automatically be thrown when you try to run your project.

00:56.650 --> 01:01.840
Most of the time, these are pretty easy to fix but we'll have a look at this and how we find and fix

01:01.840 --> 01:03.670
them in a second.

01:03.760 --> 01:09.330
The second category of errors are runtime errors, at least this is how I like to call them.

01:09.490 --> 01:16.060
Now these are errors which are not typos but where you try to execute some code which will just break

01:16.060 --> 01:23.700
when it runs and I'll show an example for this in a second too. The third kind of errors are logical errors.

01:23.700 --> 01:28.970
Now these are the most difficult ones because there, you will never see an error message,

01:29.070 --> 01:32.360
your app just doesn't work the way it should

01:32.700 --> 01:39.660
and it can be hard to find these but I will also show you some tool which can help you with that in

01:39.660 --> 01:40.630
this module.

01:41.040 --> 01:47.210
So let's now start with syntax errors and let's see how we can find these and fix these.
