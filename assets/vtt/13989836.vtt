Now that you learned a lot about building node applications and different kinds of node applications,

00:09.630 --> 00:16.680
server rendered views, rest APIs, GraphQL APIs now that you learn all about that, which of course

00:16.680 --> 00:21.720
is the meat of building node applications, let's have a look at testing.

00:21.720 --> 00:28.320
And with that, I don't mean the manual testing we did throughout the course where we simply well visit

00:28.320 --> 00:32.400
our page or test our API by sending requests, which is important.

00:32.400 --> 00:39.590
But I mean the automated testing which we can also set up where we write code to test our code.

00:39.600 --> 00:41.340
So let's have a closer look at that.
