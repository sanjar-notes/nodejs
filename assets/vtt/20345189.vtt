00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:05.580
<v Instructor>Now that's it for Deno or Deno for now.</v>

2
00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:07.260
Of course, you can dive deeper.

3
00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:08.990
Generally, however, you can of course,

4
00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:11.120
build the same things with Deno

5
00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:13.120
as you can with Node.

6
00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:15.770
Now, as I mentioned in the previous core section,

7
00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:19.890
at the end though, Deno is not as mature as Node.

8
00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.760
We have all those third-party modules

9
00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:25.760
but of course, there isn't a module for everything.

10
00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:27.370
For example, at the moment at least,

11
00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:29.760
there is no Mongoose module,

12
00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.450
which as you saw in the Node parts of this course,

13
00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:34.860
makes working with MongoDB much easier.

14
00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.170
We don't have that here, for example.

15
00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.410
Also, a lot of those third-party modules

16
00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.090
but also a lot of the standard library modules

17
00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:44.880
are work in progress,

18
00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:47.270
which means they can change over time,

19
00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:48.690
they can contain bugs,

20
00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.580
and therefore, this might not really be production ready.

21
00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:55.990
You now, however, got a good and very through introduction

22
00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:58.010
into Deno and what you can do with it

23
00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:01.090
and how you can build web applications with it.

24
00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:03.490
After all, we built a complete REST API

25
00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:06.560
with database access and a connected frontend here,

26
00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:08.403
which certainly isn't too shabby.
