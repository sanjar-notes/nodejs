00:02.540 --> 00:08.740
You already learned a lot about nodejss and how to build amazing applications with it and the

00:08.750 --> 00:11.870
express framework that builds up on nodejs.

00:12.140 --> 00:19.490
You learned a lot about reaching out to databases, handling requests, sending responses, rendering templates,

00:19.820 --> 00:25.130
working with files, a lot of crucial things that you will need for any node application you're going

00:25.130 --> 00:26.380
to build.

00:26.480 --> 00:33.860
Now I want to move away from one important thing that we always did thus far and that's the rendering

00:33.920 --> 00:36.680
of templates with ejs.

00:36.740 --> 00:44.290
It's a common thing to do that in a lot of node applications but there also is a very popular alternative

00:44.300 --> 00:51.350
kind of or a very common other kind of node application that you will work with or that you will build

00:51.560 --> 00:52.810
as a web developer

00:52.910 --> 00:54.280
and that are rest

00:54.290 --> 01:02.060
APIs. Now in this module, you will learn what exactly rest APIs are, why you would use or build

01:02.060 --> 01:09.250
them instead of the classic node express application that we built thus far where we rendered views.

01:09.500 --> 01:16.220
You will learn what the core rest concepts and principles are and we'll build our first rest API in

01:16.220 --> 01:17.400
this module too.

01:17.630 --> 01:23.150
So let's dive in and let's understand what rest APIs are and why we would well use them.
