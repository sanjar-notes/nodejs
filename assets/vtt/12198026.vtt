00:02.390 --> 00:05.900
Now we already prepared some things for production,

00:05.900 --> 00:13.010
let me now dive into that secure headers thing and for that, we'll use a third party package which is called

00:13.070 --> 00:17.810
helmet and you can use it to secure your node express applications.

00:17.840 --> 00:23.320
Now you can dive into the official docs of this package to learn more about it

00:23.450 --> 00:29.840
and in the end what this will do is this package will add certain headers to the responses you sent

00:29.840 --> 00:33.190
back and it follows best practices for doing so,

00:33.230 --> 00:40.280
you'll see which attack patterns or which security issues these are against which it protects you by

00:40.280 --> 00:41.570
setting the right headers.

00:41.570 --> 00:47.570
So definitely check that out to learn more about these headers and why it protects you against that,

00:47.990 --> 00:49.090
using the package

00:49.160 --> 00:50.550
is very easy though.

00:50.810 --> 00:58.640
In your project, you just run and install --save helmet and then this will be downloaded and

00:58.640 --> 01:03.950
you can use it as you see here by simply including it as a middleware and then it will automatically

01:03.950 --> 01:09.860
run on all incoming requests and therefore also have a chance of adjusting the responses as you

01:09.860 --> 01:10.420
learned

01:10.550 --> 01:19.130
and it will then set its headers. So you can simply go to your app.js file then and there, import helmet

01:19.220 --> 01:22.050
by requiring it like this

01:22.170 --> 01:29.010
and then as a next step, you simply add this line here after you initialized your express app, maybe

01:29.160 --> 01:34.000
in the place where we then also set up all our other middleware down there.

01:34.020 --> 01:40.110
Here we can use app use helmet and execute this as a function, and this is it.

01:40.110 --> 01:48.710
Now with that, if I run npm run start:dev, my new script I added to use nodemon,

01:48.930 --> 01:57.790
everything runs as before but now actually if I visit localhost 3000 here and I hope my network tab

01:58.040 --> 02:05.810
and I reload this page, I can see that on this response, I have a couple of headers being set and there are

02:05.810 --> 02:13.400
some special headers which were added by helmet here and you can always check that by temporarily commenting

02:13.520 --> 02:17.640
out helmet, we'll automatically restart since I'm using nodemon,

02:17.750 --> 02:22.430
we had 11 response headers before, if I now reload this,

02:22.550 --> 02:26.960
we just have 6 because now some special headers are missing.

02:27.140 --> 02:29.570
And that is something you should consider doing,

02:29.630 --> 02:33.770
read through the official docs to learn all about the headers

02:33.800 --> 02:38.810
it is adding but it's definitely worth looking at that and probably worth using that.
