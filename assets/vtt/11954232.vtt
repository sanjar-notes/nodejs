So in the last lecture I showed you how you can set a cookie and some a bit too complex way of extracting

00:08.900 --> 00:09.740
that cookie.

00:09.740 --> 00:13.910
Now if you want to extract cookies by the way, there also are third party packages which can help you

00:13.910 --> 00:14.780
with that

00:14.780 --> 00:17.540
but our approach has another flaw.

00:18.050 --> 00:22.500
Well obviously since I can access my cookies that easily

00:22.540 --> 00:28.130
in the developer tools, I can easily change them, I can go here and manipulate the value,

00:28.160 --> 00:32.330
for example if I set it to false and I reload,

00:32.330 --> 00:33.760
I'm actually still logged in

00:33.770 --> 00:38.180
because false is sent as text and text is always treated as true

00:38.360 --> 00:47.120
but we can simply add a comparison here and see if that value is equal to true, so to the text true here

00:47.690 --> 00:52.040
and now if I reload here, I'm not logged in anymore.

00:52.040 --> 00:52.900
If I change it back to

00:52.910 --> 00:55.510
true though and I do reload,

00:55.640 --> 00:56.570
I am.

00:56.570 --> 01:02.750
So the issue here is we can manipulate that from inside the browser and obviously you don't want to

01:02.750 --> 01:08.560
allow the users of your website to login by simply manipulating some cookie value.

01:08.630 --> 01:14.870
So whilst it is certainly interesting to store some data in the client side, especially things that are

01:14.870 --> 01:18.720
related to tracking users, advertisements tracking and so on,

01:18.800 --> 01:25.310
whilst this is interesting, sensitive data should not be stored in the browser because users can edit

01:25.310 --> 01:29.460
them as you see, we can edit our logged in cookie. So whilst

01:29.470 --> 01:34.750
cookies are generally a good thing for storing data across requests,

01:34.910 --> 01:41.240
it might not be the best approach in all scenarios and that is exactly something where sessions can

01:41.240 --> 01:42.010
help us with.

01:42.200 --> 01:47.870
However before we dive into sessions, let me quickly explain you some other fields you can configure

01:47.870 --> 01:52.680
about a cookie which will also highlight when a cookie does make sense to be used

01:52.700 --> 01:55.960
before we then dive into the scenario where it's not the best tool.
