WEBVTT

00:02.110 --> 00:04.510
Now that we're able to save products,

00:04.510 --> 00:07.310
obviously we again want to be able to fetch them.

00:07.450 --> 00:09.600
So let's head over to the shop.js

00:09.610 --> 00:16.750
file in the controllers folder and let's start working on get products and get index actions there so that we

00:16.750 --> 00:18.750
can indeed fetch all products.

00:18.790 --> 00:23.020
Now we got no fetch all method in mongoose,

00:23.020 --> 00:28.780
that was a method we defined on our own but we can still use something on the product model which we're

00:28.780 --> 00:35.170
still importing from the product models folder and which is the mongoose model in the end and there we

00:35.170 --> 00:36.970
got a couple of static methods,

00:36.970 --> 00:39.470
you can find all in the official docs of course

00:39.520 --> 00:44.030
and one of them is the find method which you already know from the mongodb driver.

00:44.080 --> 00:47.740
Now find works a bit differently when used with mongoose,

00:47.740 --> 00:49.840
it does not give us a cursor

00:49.960 --> 00:56.970
instead it does give us the products, we could add .cursor and call this to get access to the cursor

00:57.280 --> 01:03.160
and then use each async which would allow us to loop through them or next to get the next element

01:03.310 --> 01:10.550
but I will just use find and this will essentially give me all my products automatically.

01:10.570 --> 01:16.470
So then in products, I should get my products and I should be able to output them,

01:16.510 --> 01:21.450
so if I now console log my products here so that we can also see them,

01:21.880 --> 01:28.240
we have to go to the shop route as well and there we want to include the get index route and the get

01:28.240 --> 01:29.420
products route

01:29.470 --> 01:35.550
and since I also did include the get index route here, I of course also need to work on get index in my shop.js

01:35.560 --> 01:43.480
file in the controllers folder, there we also want to use find instead of fetch all but that should

01:43.480 --> 01:44.020
be it.

01:44.050 --> 01:47.750
If we now save everything and we go to the products page,

01:47.890 --> 01:49.460
indeed I do see my product here

01:49.480 --> 01:50.620
so this is looking good

01:50.740 --> 01:55.990
and if I go back, well then I see here is the output of the data that was fetched 

01:55.990 --> 02:00.670
and you see I get an array here because find when used with mongoose automatically

02:00.660 --> 02:02.230
gives me that array here.

02:02.260 --> 02:07.270 
Now again if you know you will query large amounts of data, you should turn this into a cursor

02:07.360 --> 02:13.510
or of course manipulate find to limit the set of data that is retrieved, something we will see in the

02:13.510 --> 02:16.470
pagination module later in the course.

02:16.490 --> 02:21.490
So here I now got my working get products and get index route,

02:21.700 --> 02:25.540
let's next work on the detail route for a single product.
