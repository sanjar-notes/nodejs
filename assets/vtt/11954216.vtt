Enough about databases for now but let's stick to storing data and let me dive into some mechanisms

00:09.070 --> 00:13.270
of storing data in memory or even on the client side,

00:13.270 --> 00:18.730
so in the browser. And for that in this module, we'll have a look at the sessions and cookies,

00:18.880 --> 00:24.820
two important constructs or technologies in web development in general which you can of course also

00:24.820 --> 00:30.140
use in nodejs. Now in this module, we'll have a look at what exactly cookies are

00:30.160 --> 00:36.400
and of course what exactly sessions are and then how you can use both and how you typically use them

00:36.430 --> 00:37.360
together.

00:37.360 --> 00:42.430
So let's dive in and let's understand what these things are and how we can add them to our project and

00:42.490 --> 00:43.690
why we would add them.
