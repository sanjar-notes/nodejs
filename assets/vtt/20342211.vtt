1
00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:06.130
<v Narrator>So let's get started with Deno.</v>

2
00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:09.160
And what better way to get started than to write

3
00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:12.760
our first very simple Deno program.

4
00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:17.193
For that visit deno.land, yes, that is a valid URL.

5
00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:21.810
And there, you will be able to learn more about Deno,

6
00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.020
but you will also learn more about it in this course.

7
00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:26.640
Of course, most importantly, you will find

8
00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.900
installation instructions for different environments

9
00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:32.420
and also using different approaches.

10
00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:35.230
Now you can, of course use any of the approaches

11
00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:38.260
being listed here depending on your operating system

12
00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:39.380
and what you want to do.

13
00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:42.760
And if you click on this Deno installing here,

14
00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:45.540
you also will again find a nice overview

15
00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:48.960
of all possible ways of installing Deno.

16
00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.790
Now we might be getting different installation options

17
00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:53.100
in the future.

18
00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.980
For the moment, I will use one of those options.

19
00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:59.860
On Mac and Linux, you can simply copy this command here

20
00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:01.790
into the default terminal.

21
00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:04.620
On Windows you can copy this command here

22
00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:06.670
into the windows PowerShell.

23
00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:09.040
So not the normal Command Prompt you got

24
00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:11.680
on your operating system, but the PowerShell.

25
00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:14.010
Which is already pre-installed in which you can launch

26
00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.410
as a program on Windows.

27
00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:18.760
Since I'm on a Mac, I'm going to use this command.

28
00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:21.380
So I'll just paste this here into my terminal,

29
00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:23.330
this curl command and hit Enter.

30
00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:25.520
And this will download this install script,

31
00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:29.330
download Deno and install Deno on my machine.

32
00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:31.370
Now, what you'll see is that once

33
00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:34.570
this finishes successfully, that I won't be able

34
00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:35.640
to run Deno.

35
00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.760
Normally there should be a Deno command,

36
00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:40.320
which you can execute by just typing Deno

37
00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.610
in your terminal or a Command Prompt.

38
00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:45.313
But if I do that, I get command not found.

39
00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.750
But actually I get the fix here as well.

40
00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.600
After the installation, that I should manually add

41
00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.690
the directory to your Home bash profile or similar.

42
00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:58.540
These two entries to be precise.

43
00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:00.850
You can just copy and paste these entries.

44
00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:03.450
And again, depending on the point of time

45
00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:06.640
you're watching this and on the operating system you're on,

46
00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:08.220
the exact instructions

47
00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.090
you are seeing here might differ.

48
00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:13.560
Simply follow the instructions you are seeing here.

49
00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.860
In my case, I should add these two instructions

50
00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:18.960
to my bash profile, which is basically a configuration file

51
00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:22.390
for your whole system, which tells your operating system

52
00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:24.890
which commands are available in the Command Prompt,

53
00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:26.220
so to say.

54
00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:28.610
Now, since I'm on Mac OS Catalina,

55
00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:30.660
I don't need the bash profile.

56
00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:33.170
You only need that if you have a Mac version,

57
00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:36.870
a smaller or older than Catalina.

58
00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:37.742
If you have Catalina,

59
00:02:37.742 --> 00:02:41.610
you should look into your users folder

60
00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:45.570
for a .zprofile file.

61
00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:46.540
If you're not seeing that,

62
00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:48.823
make sure you're showing hidden files.

63
00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:52.520
Then you can just edit this and in case you don't have it,

64
00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:56.200
you can simply create such a .zprofile file.

65
00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:58.173
And I'm going to edit it with TextEdit.

66
00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:01.850
And in there, the file might look different for you,

67
00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:04.900
but in there, the only important thing is that at the end

68
00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:08.960
you add these lines you saw in the Command Prompt.

69
00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:10.720
So that's what I'm doing here.

70
00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:14.140
And with that, save that file, close it

71
00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:15.870
and open a new terminal.

72
00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:19.090
So close the terminal and open a new one.

73
00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:22.350
And once you do that, you should be able to run Deno

74
00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:24.290
and it does not give you an error,

75
00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:27.400
but instead entered this interactive mode here.

76
00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:30.100
Now let's explore this and what we can do with Deno

77
00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:31.203
in the next lecture.

78
00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:35.190
So now this was Mac OS, now for Windows,

79
00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:38.670
I'm going to grab this command for the PowerShell

80
00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:41.010
and just open up the PowerShell,

81
00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:44.410
which is a default tool on Windows.

82
00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:47.840
And in there, I'll just copy it in and hit Enter.

83
00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:50.750
And this is now going to basically send the request

84
00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:54.500
to Deno's servers and also run an installation script

85
00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:57.350
to install Deno on our system.

86
00:03:57.350 --> 00:04:00.133
So let's wait for this to finish.

87
00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:05.500
And once this finished, unlike on Mac OS,

88
00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:08.860
I'm not even prompted here to do anything else,

89
00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:10.870
and you probably aren't either.

90
00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:12.720
And therefore we can just go ahead

91
00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:16.290
and type the Deno command right away and it should work here

92
00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:18.063
instead of the PowerShell.

93
00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:22.610
So that's how easy it is to set up Deno on Windows.

94
00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:24.853
And before that also on Mac OS.

95
00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:28.930
With that done, you should have Deno installed,

96
00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:31.410
and if you now restart the terminal

97
00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:34.583
or the Command Prompt or PowerShell,

98
00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:38.670
you are able to run Deno just like this.

99
00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:41.650
This is now a globally available command.

100
00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:45.290
And if you run it, you enter the Deno rappel.

101
00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:48.080
Now, you know the rappel from Node.js.

102
00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:51.230
If you run Node, you enter the Node rappel,

103
00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:53.730
and there you can execute basic Node code.

104
00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:56.030
You can use it as a basic calculator

105
00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:59.793
and you can quit it with control C or control D.

106
00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:03.510
And for Deno, it's the same.

107
00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:05.630
You enter the Deno rappel here.

108
00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:07.690
You can execute basic Deno code.

109
00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:11.090
You can use it as a basic calculator and you can quit it

110
00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:14.313
with control D or by running Close.

111
00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:17.250
Now, the idea is the same.

112
00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:19.580
This is really just a nice playground,

113
00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:22.360
or to try out some things in reality,

114
00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:25.130
you're going to write JavaScript code

115
00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:26.930
or TypeScript code with Deno,

116
00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:28.890
and you can then run those code files

117
00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:30.520
with the Deno executable.

118
00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:33.090
That's how you would run most of the code

119
00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:35.070
when working with Deno.

120
00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:36.630
Now, speaking of that,

121
00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:39.770
let's maybe write some first Deno code

122
00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:42.860
so that we get an idea for how it works

123
00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:46.230
and also so that we can gradually dive

124
00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:48.803
into the differences compared to Node.
