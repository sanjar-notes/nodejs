You learned about a brand new type of backend application you can build with nodejs and restful API

00:10.200 --> 00:16.770
and you learned that it's not that far off from the server side rendered node application we built before,

00:16.890 --> 00:20.600
the only major difference is how you handle requests and response data,

00:20.760 --> 00:23.940
you send json data. Now with that out of the way,

00:23.970 --> 00:30.870
I want to dive into something totally different which is applicable to any node application, not just

00:30.870 --> 00:32.390
to restful APIs.

00:32.670 --> 00:39.960
I want to dive into the async await keywords which is a relatively new javascript language feature which

00:39.960 --> 00:43.240
you can use again in any place in your nodejs

00:43.250 --> 00:50.700
code, this does not have to be used in a restful API, you can or can not use it anywhere.

00:50.730 --> 00:56.140
Now I will explain what's up with these two keywords, how you use them and why you would use them.
