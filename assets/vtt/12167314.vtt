00:02.460 --> 00:05.880
So now we also manage updating via socket.io,

00:06.030 --> 00:08.510
there's one tiny thing you might be wondering about.

00:08.730 --> 00:12.390
If we create a new post, like a duck again

00:14.030 --> 00:16.620
where I add the image and some content,

00:16.620 --> 00:21.980
it does show up at the top but once I reload, it's actually at the bottom of the list.

00:22.320 --> 00:25.320
Well this is simply due to how I sort on the backend

00:25.500 --> 00:34.020
when I get all posts here in our feed.js controller get posts, there we simply have to sort

00:36.860 --> 00:42.230
by createdAt date in a descending way.

00:43.190 --> 00:48.830
And now by doing that, if I reload on the frontend, our latest posts come first there too.

00:48.850 --> 00:54.830
So that's just some tiny cosmetics which better align with the rest of our application of course,

00:55.090 --> 00:58.060
it doesn't affect the way we use socket.io though of course.
