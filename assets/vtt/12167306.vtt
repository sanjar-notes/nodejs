By the way if you're wondering why there is no name being displayed,

00:07.170 --> 00:16.490
I have it back on my backend code here in get posts, we should add populate creator to not just fetch the

00:16.530 --> 00:21.130
creator ID but the full object for that creator and on create post,

00:21.160 --> 00:27.010
well there we have the issue that the post I am sending through socket.io is just a post object where

00:27.070 --> 00:33.780
I did add my creator ID but not all the creator data.

00:33.790 --> 00:37.950
Now how can we fix that or how can we add more data?

00:38.170 --> 00:46.610
Well we can send the entire post _doc data, so all the data about the post but set the creator

00:46.690 --> 00:52.970
equal to an object where we do have the _id, that will be our request

00:52.970 --> 00:53.780
user ID

00:57.210 --> 01:04.860
but where I also then add my name field which will be user.name and user.name can be used because of

01:04.860 --> 01:08.360
fetching the user here and that will be an object which also has a name.

01:08.640 --> 01:16.040
So that's just a little tweak we want to add here to send all the data with a created post that we

01:16.040 --> 01:17.210
need on the frontend.

01:17.360 --> 01:23.050
If we now save that and we reload, we get the data up because of that change in get posts and if I now

01:23.050 --> 01:33.480
add a new post, another duck, choose a duck, add some content and click acccept, we also see the name there.

01:33.510 --> 01:38.460
Now both users are named Max but still keep in mind, the left user we logged in with is a different

01:38.460 --> 01:42.510
user than on the right and still we get the updates here due to socket.io.
