00:01.930 --> 00:05.050
So we worked a lot on resetting passwords.

00:05.080 --> 00:07.510
Let's now work on authorization.

00:07.510 --> 00:13.780
And with that, I mean that not every authenticated user is allowed to do everything.

00:14.140 --> 00:16.120
A good example would be this one.

00:16.300 --> 00:17.560
I'm not logged in now.

00:17.560 --> 00:19.630
Let me log in with this user here.

00:20.170 --> 00:21.520
Test a test dot com.

00:23.170 --> 00:30.130
Here, I might be able to add a product and I can delete products, but right now I can delete all products

00:30.130 --> 00:33.820
no matter if I created them or if someone else created them.

00:33.820 --> 00:35.890
And the same is true for editing them.

00:36.210 --> 00:44.770
Authorization means that I restrict the permissions of a logged in user, so every user might be able

00:44.770 --> 00:48.760
to add anything to the card, including products created by the user.

00:48.910 --> 00:53.620
But you might not be able to delete and edit products which were not created by you.

00:53.890 --> 01:00.370
So for now, I can do that, but that's exactly what I want to work on next so that we can't do this.

01:00.520 --> 01:02.620
Now, how can we implement that?

01:03.310 --> 01:09.520
Well, when I create a new product and let me quickly do that, remember, I'm locked in with test at

01:09.520 --> 01:10.970
test com.

01:12.150 --> 01:17.380
This was created by test at test dotcom.

01:17.400 --> 01:22.700
When I create this product here, we have it here and we can see it in the product collection.

01:22.710 --> 01:28.170
Obviously it's linked to the user with an ID that ends with E five.

01:28.170 --> 01:32.970
And if we have a look at all our users, let me delete this one here.

01:33.450 --> 01:35.300
Then we see this is the one with E five.

01:35.310 --> 01:37.260
It is to test a test dot com user.

01:37.590 --> 01:42.120
Now if I log in with my test to account.

01:43.080 --> 01:44.760
So test to here.

01:47.080 --> 01:49.510
Then if I go to Avon products.

01:50.380 --> 01:54.210
I can also edit and delete that and that is exactly what I want to prevent.

01:54.220 --> 01:56.110
Let's do that in the next lecture.
