00:02.190 --> 00:03.440
Editing fails here

00:03.570 --> 00:06.520
and do you have an idea why it fails?

00:07.020 --> 00:08.930
It fails because of my check here,

00:08.940 --> 00:12.160
I compare the product user ID to the request user ID.

00:12.180 --> 00:18.390
Now we have a type problem again, I should convert both to a string because I'm also checking for type

00:18.390 --> 00:19.250
equality.

00:19.590 --> 00:27.770
So with this change, both converted to a string and not this strange object id thing, with this in place,

00:27.810 --> 00:31.440
now if I login or if I'm logged in with the right account,

00:31.660 --> 00:36.660
now I can update this and I can also delete this.

00:36.750 --> 00:40.330
So this now all works with the right account,

00:40.330 --> 00:42.370
so with the account who created it

00:45.600 --> 00:51.210
but it will not work if I login with the wrong account because if I login there,

00:51.240 --> 00:53.990
so this is now the account which did not create it,

00:54.210 --> 00:56.060
I can view it on the normal pages,

00:56.160 --> 01:00.980
I can add it to my cart if I want to but under admin products, I do not see it

01:01.020 --> 01:04.120
and even if I would see it, I could not interact with it.
