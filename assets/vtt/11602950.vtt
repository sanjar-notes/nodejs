We added our products controller in the last lecture,

00:05.430 --> 00:10.900
now let's also make sure we handle the 404 route with a controller.

00:10.950 --> 00:15.540
In theory this is of course is not required, it's totally optional but it's a good practice.

00:15.600 --> 00:20.920
So definitely pause the video here and try this on your own before we then do that together,

00:21.090 --> 00:27.360
make sure to decide which controller you want to use, a new one or the existing products controller and

00:27.360 --> 00:30.170
how you would extract the 404,

00:30.180 --> 00:36.180
here is the 404 page logic into that controller and connect the existing route to it,

00:36.180 --> 00:39.860
good luck.

00:40.010 --> 00:40.570
Were you

00:40.580 --> 00:41.820
successful?

00:41.840 --> 00:48.170
Let's try that out and for that, let's first of all identify where we are rendering that 404 route

00:48.470 --> 00:51.780
and that is in the app.js file here at the bottom.

00:51.830 --> 00:54.420
Now we can absolutely leave that code here,

00:54.530 --> 01:00.790
it's very simple and there's nothing wrong with it but to be in line with our other code, I also

01:00.790 --> 01:06.800
want to put that into a controller. Now it's clearly not related to products because we can have many features

01:06.800 --> 01:11.990
on our page and every path can fail or the user can enter any random path,

01:12.080 --> 01:14.550
so instead I'll create a new controller here

01:14.810 --> 01:16.850
and you can name this however you want,

01:16.850 --> 01:18.590
you can name it 404.js,

01:18.620 --> 01:20.350
I'll name it

01:20.490 --> 01:29.480
error.js and in there, I will export a function with exports and then I'll name it get 404 page

01:30.020 --> 01:37.280
or you get 404 to be in line with get products which I have in the other controller and now I will cut

01:37.310 --> 01:38.600
that function here,

01:38.660 --> 01:43.530
this middleware function from app.js and in error.js,

01:43.550 --> 01:48.030
this is what I will store here in get 404.

01:48.050 --> 01:52.130
This is my function where I return the 404 page

01:52.250 --> 01:55.220
and with this I just have to go back to app.js

01:55.370 --> 01:59.720
and in there, I will simply import my controller,

01:59.870 --> 02:07.640
so const error controller is imported by going to the controllers folder and there to the error.js

02:07.640 --> 02:14.870
file and we can now take that error controller here and down there on app use,

02:15.000 --> 02:21.600
I will simply put error controller get 404, just like this as a reference to this function.

02:21.720 --> 02:27.530
And now this is also in line with the other routes and with the other products controller.

02:27.960 --> 02:30.450
So this is now the controller being added

02:30.450 --> 02:33.060
and with that we get views and controllers.

02:33.060 --> 02:34.970
Let's move on to the model next.
