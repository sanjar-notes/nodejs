00:02.170 --> 00:07.460
In this module let's have a look at something you can't avoid, errors.

00:07.500 --> 00:14.580
There will be errors in the applications, in the webpages you create and some errors can of course be

00:14.580 --> 00:17.460
avoided by testing your code properly

00:17.460 --> 00:20.380
but some errors are due to happen.

00:20.400 --> 00:26.910
You will always have some bugs or issues in your code and even if you don't, your database server might be

00:26.910 --> 00:30.260
offline, users do send invalid data,

00:30.360 --> 00:37.170
so there will be errors and in this module, we'll have a look at different types of errors and how to handle

00:37.170 --> 00:40.240
these different types of errors in an elegant way

00:40.260 --> 00:42.600
in your node express application.
