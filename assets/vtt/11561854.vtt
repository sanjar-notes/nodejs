00:02.000 --> 00:09.260
Welcome to this optional that's important optional module where I want to introduce you to the JavaScript

00:09.260 --> 00:10.100
basics.

00:10.100 --> 00:13.130
And this module is really just a quick refresher.

00:13.910 --> 00:19.700
I do expect you to have some basic knowledge about how JavaScript works, what you use it for at its

00:19.700 --> 00:20.900
base syntax.

00:20.900 --> 00:23.630
This module does not replace that.

00:23.630 --> 00:29.510
You can't really use that module with zero JavaScript knowledge, or at least it will be very, very

00:29.510 --> 00:30.560
challenging.

00:30.680 --> 00:37.130
But if you only get some very basic knowledge or it's been quite some time since you worked with JavaScript,

00:37.130 --> 00:40.340
then this module will be a great refresher.

00:41.630 --> 00:48.260
Please skip this module if you already know JavaScript though, because then this module is not for

00:48.260 --> 00:48.700
you.

00:48.710 --> 00:51.330
So you don't have to be an expert to skip this.

00:51.350 --> 00:58.700
If you know JavaScript and you also know some of its next gen features like the rest and spread operator

00:58.700 --> 01:00.830
or object structuring.

01:00.830 --> 01:04.160
So a bunch of nice things that we can do in JavaScript.

01:04.160 --> 01:10.010
Definitely skip this module and maybe come back later if there is some feature you don't recognize or

01:10.010 --> 01:11.960
you're not sure what it's all about.

01:12.830 --> 01:16.400
If you don't have that knowledge though, this module is for you.

01:16.400 --> 01:23.330
And also have a look at the next lecture where I provide links to helpful resources in case you're brand

01:23.360 --> 01:30.170
new to JavaScript, because there are some free resources that allow you to get started with JavaScript,

01:30.200 --> 01:35.060
after which you can come back to this module and to the rest of the course where you will need that

01:35.060 --> 01:36.290
basic knowledge.
