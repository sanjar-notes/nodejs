Now I did mention on the slide that you also want to exchange testing keys for production keys and in our case,

00:08.850 --> 00:13.780
that would be that stripe key we're using here through environment variables which we do set in the

00:13.790 --> 00:16.650
nodemon and in the package.json file.

00:16.650 --> 00:24.000
Now obviously that always depends on which kind of APIs or third party services you are using. Maybe

00:24.000 --> 00:27.840
in your app, you use no service at all and therefore this is not an issue for you,

00:28.050 --> 00:33.900
with stripe what you want to do is you want to click on that to switch to public or to production ready

00:34.310 --> 00:35.420
data.

00:35.480 --> 00:41.040
Now you need to activate your account here to be able to do that as you see and to activate your account,

00:41.190 --> 00:45.970
you have to fill out some information including some payment information.

00:46.410 --> 00:48.530
And therefore I will not do that here

00:48.570 --> 00:54.570
but if you were to deploy this into production, you need to fill that all out and once you fill that out,

00:54.780 --> 01:01.740
you will be able to switch that toggle here here at the top and see your live data, your production ready

01:01.740 --> 01:05.110
keys and you should use these keys in your code.

01:05.190 --> 01:10.230
So wherever you are using the test keys right now, you would have to replace them with the production

01:10.230 --> 01:13.970
ready keys and that is just a stripe example, other APIs

01:13.980 --> 01:16.630
you might be using might have a similar behavior.
