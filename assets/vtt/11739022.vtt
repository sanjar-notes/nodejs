Let's make edit work and for this, we first of all need to load the product that gets edited

00:08.390 --> 00:13.710
so we're looking at the get edit product function in the admin.js controller.

00:14.060 --> 00:17.650
We still want to retrieve that edit mode thing and the product ID as

00:17.660 --> 00:22.460
we did it before. We can also still find a product by ID,

00:22.460 --> 00:31.370
however as before, we'll not use a callback function here but our promise where we catch any errors we

00:31.370 --> 00:32.540
might have

00:32.540 --> 00:38.720
and then here we pass that function which gets the product to then. If we get no product, we redirect

00:38.720 --> 00:45.830
which is fine and otherwise we'll render the view with our loaded product. With this tiny change already

00:45.830 --> 00:49.500
if we save this and we reload the edit product page,

00:49.530 --> 00:50.790
this is looking good,

00:50.840 --> 00:54.260
the fields get populated with our values.

00:54.290 --> 01:00.650
Now we just need to make sure that if we do change something and we save it, this does get saved to the

01:00.650 --> 01:02.870
database correctly.

01:02.870 --> 01:08.600
For that, we of course have to have a look at post edit product which gets called once we submit this

01:08.600 --> 01:16.370
page. There, we retrieve all the data we need which is good but we won't save our product like this

01:16.370 --> 01:25.580
instead here, we'll use the product model and first of all here, I want to find the element in the database

01:25.580 --> 01:26.990
which we do want to change, 

01:27.010 --> 01:31.590
so I'll use find by ID here and I'll pass my prod ID to find it.

01:32.710 --> 01:36.750
Then you know the game, we got then and catch,

01:36.760 --> 01:44.250
so let's just handle any error by logging them for now and in then, let's work with the product

01:44.260 --> 01:48.290
we retrieved, that product now needs to be updated.

01:48.580 --> 01:56.380
So here we can simply do that by now saying product title equals updated title, so we can simply work with

01:56.470 --> 02:02.370
all the attributes our product has per our model definition and change them,

02:02.380 --> 02:08.290
please note this will not directly change the data in the database though, it will only do it locally in

02:08.290 --> 02:11.340
our app, in our javascript app here for the moment.

02:11.650 --> 02:18.910
So I can also change product title to updated price, to updated price, I can change the description to

02:18.940 --> 02:24.910
updated desc and I can also change product image

02:24.910 --> 02:31.980
url to updated image url. Now as I said this will not directly edit it in the database,

02:32.080 --> 02:36.170
to do that we simply have to call product save.

02:36.180 --> 02:38.860
This is another method provided by sequelize

02:39.010 --> 02:45.300
and this now takes the product as we edit it and saves it back to the database.

02:45.360 --> 02:49.000
If the product does not exist yet, it will create a new one

02:49.020 --> 02:56.940
but if it does as this one, then it will overwrite or update the old one with our new values.

02:56.940 --> 03:04.500
Now here we can again chain then and catch but to not start nesting our promises which would yield

03:04.500 --> 03:07.400
the same ugly picture as nesting callbacks,

03:07.710 --> 03:15.400
we can now return this here, so we return the promise which is returned by save and we can simply add

03:15.410 --> 03:24.010
a then block here and this catch block, whoops, this catch block would catch errors both for this first promise

03:24.010 --> 03:24.450
here

03:24.690 --> 03:31.770 
and for the second promise. This then block will now handle any success responses from this save promise

03:31.770 --> 03:32.610
here,

03:32.610 --> 03:44.970
so here we get back result and I will simply log updated product. Time to save that and to go back and

03:45.090 --> 03:51.030
edit this by adding a couple of exclamation marks. Let's click update product now, we get redirected

03:51.030 --> 03:52.900
to the products page,

03:53.130 --> 03:56.460
here we don't see our change though but if we reload, we do

03:56.970 --> 04:03.900
and in the database if we refreshed that here, we are of course also can see that change here.

04:04.900 --> 04:12.900
Now do you know why we didn't immediately see that change on our admin products page though? Well the

04:12.900 --> 04:15.600
reason is we redirect here

04:15.600 --> 04:23.070
and as you learned, javascript and nodejs simply executes your code from top to bottom but async operations

04:23.070 --> 04:29.860
like this simply get registered and started and then here for promises, we registered that this function

04:29.860 --> 04:32.950
should be executed once the promise is resolved.

04:33.240 --> 04:38.610
So it will not wait for this to finish but instead move onto the next line and the next line is this

04:38.610 --> 04:39.420
one here,

04:39.570 --> 04:42.590
so it will redirect before our promise is done.

04:42.690 --> 04:48.570
So we should simply move redirect into the then block here. By the way this also means that for now if

04:48.570 --> 04:53.850
we have an error, we never load a new page which is not the best user experience but we'll learn more

04:53.850 --> 04:57.780
about error handling in a separate module of the course.

04:57.780 --> 05:00.360
So for now, this is the setup I want to use

05:00.360 --> 05:07.080
and with that if I now edit this and I remove the exclamation marks and I do let's say also change the

05:07.080 --> 05:09.800
price here, if I now save that,

05:09.960 --> 05:16.270
now we immediately see the new values because now we only redirect after the update was successful.
