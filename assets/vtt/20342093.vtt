<v Instructor>In this module,</v>

2
00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:09.010
I don't just have a new slide deck with new colors,

3
00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:11.180
but more importantly, in this module,

4
00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:15.410
we're going to dive into a new way of writing our node code.

5
00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:19.860
You'll learn how to use Node.js with TypeScript

6
00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:23.060
basically to write node Express code

7
00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:25.090
as you learned throughout this module

8
00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:28.690
with extra features provided by TypeScript.

9
00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:30.550
Now, for that in the next lecture,

10
00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:33.350
I'll first of all explain what exactly TypeScript is

11
00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:35.600
and why you might want to use it.

12
00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:39.990
I want to say right away that using it is 100% optional,

13
00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:42.410
and you don't need to use it.

14
00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:44.240
Otherwise this module would have come

15
00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:46.870
way earlier in the course, of course.

16
00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:48.080
What you'll learn in this course

17
00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:52.490
is 100% correct and 100% relevant.

18
00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:55.070
What you'll learn in this module, we'll just build up

19
00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:56.460
on the knowledge you gain there

20
00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.270
and show you a slightly different way of writing your code,

21
00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.940
utilizing TypeScript, but as you will see

22
00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.330
throughout this module, and also in the conclusion

23
00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:07.980
at the end of the module, the code you write will

24
00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:09.320
not really differ that much,

25
00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:12.160
and you will use everything you learn in this course,

26
00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:14.740
just with extra features added,

27
00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:18.150
if you want to have a better development experience,

28
00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.513
and to avoid unnecessary errors.
