00:02.310 --> 00:06.800
In the last module, you learned how to use SQL in a nodejs application

00:06.800 --> 00:12.620
and we did this at the example of a MySQL database which we want to use to store data.

00:12.620 --> 00:21.050
Now we didn't complete the project with that SQL approach simply because in this module, we'll now implement

00:21.320 --> 00:27.220
other features like for example working with the shopping cart with the help of sequelize.

00:27.260 --> 00:31.650
This will still use a SQL database, still use the same

00:31.670 --> 00:38.240
MySQL database actually behind the scenes or in the background as a database but the code we write

00:38.510 --> 00:40.200
will be different.

00:40.490 --> 00:46.760
Instead of SQL statements as we have them here and as we wrote them in the last module, we'll use

00:46.900 --> 00:54.410
a third party package that allows us to work with javascript objects and convenient methods to create

00:54.440 --> 01:01.720
new elements in the database, to edit them, to delete them or to find them and also to connect them

01:01.760 --> 01:06.570
because you remember, a SQL database typically also works with relations

01:06.650 --> 01:10.040
and we got lot of these in our current project.

01:10.040 --> 01:12.410
So this is what we'll dive into in this module, 

01:12.410 --> 01:14.820
you'll learn what exactly sequelize,

01:14.870 --> 01:21.170
this third party package is and how you can use it and we'll then implement our products and our cart

01:21.260 --> 01:24.530
and so on in this module with sequelize.
