Amazing job, you made it through the entire course and that means you learned a lot about node and the many

00:08.470 --> 00:14.290
ways you can use it to build exciting web applications or any kind of application that needs to execute

00:14.290 --> 00:15.350
some code really.

00:15.640 --> 00:20.700
I hope you enjoyed the course and the obvious question is how should you now continue?

00:21.040 --> 00:27.020
Well in general, the most important thing I always recommend is that you keep on practicing,

00:27.070 --> 00:29.070
build example projects,

00:29.200 --> 00:33.940
clone popular apps, build your own simplified facebook clone,

00:33.940 --> 00:40.660
strip out some features you don't want to focus on and instead build some parts of that application

00:40.780 --> 00:41.590
you picked.

00:41.600 --> 00:44.630
Build the messaging part, build the newsfeed part,

00:44.680 --> 00:46.160
anything like that,

00:46.300 --> 00:51.760
practicing is important and the most important thing there is that you will face issues.

00:51.760 --> 00:53.360
You'll hit some problems,

00:53.440 --> 00:58.720
there will be things what you want to build where you don't know how to continue or you don't know

00:58.750 --> 00:59.690
how it works

00:59.830 --> 01:06.190
and this is then the part where you need to dig in, where you need to research. Search on Stack Overflow, find

01:06.190 --> 01:11.740
blog posts on Google that help you and dig through that problem on your own,

01:11.740 --> 01:18.040
this will make you a better developer and it will help you learn how things work internally and how

01:18.040 --> 01:20.960
you can approach certain problems and solve them,

01:21.010 --> 01:23.460
this is the most important part really.

01:23.620 --> 01:31.160
Now also dive into other concepts related to nodejs. Dive into APIs like rest API or graphql,

01:31.360 --> 01:39.760
learn more about these technologies, build example projects there too, dive into serverless technologies

01:39.760 --> 01:41.830
and to serverless services,

01:41.830 --> 01:47.380
I got a course on that but you can also just google for nodejs serverless and you'll find some great

01:47.380 --> 01:53.380
resource there because that is also a very promising interesting way of creating node applications as

01:53.380 --> 01:54.140
you will learn,

01:54.160 --> 01:59.770
you focus way more on your logic and way less on the overhead of spinning up a server and so on,.

01:59.810 --> 02:06.370
so really interesting. And maybe also dive into frontend development, learn how to build a react app

02:06.490 --> 02:12.100
like the one I gave you in this course from scratch, that could be a great next step too because it will

02:12.100 --> 02:14.970
make you a full stack developer who can do both,

02:15.070 --> 02:20.710
backend development and frontend development. And these are just some of the possibilities you have,

02:21.130 --> 02:26.860
obviously as you practice you'll dive into more things that are interesting to you and to your exact

02:26.860 --> 02:30.470
requirements and things that are interesting to you

02:30.640 --> 02:36.310
and I'm confident that this course gave you pretty solid fundamentals that allow you to build up on

02:36.400 --> 02:38.180
to dive way deeper.
