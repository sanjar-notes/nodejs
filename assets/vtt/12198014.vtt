WEBVTT

00:02.280 --> 00:04.830
You did it. You built an amazing nodejs

00:04.850 --> 00:11.640
application and in this course, we actually build a couple of applications and we're typically

00:11.640 --> 00:19.590
not just doing this for our own practice or to do it on our PC only, instead we of course want to deploy

00:19.620 --> 00:23.930
this application into the web so that it is reachable by other people

00:24.000 --> 00:28.450
because as long as it's running on localhost, only you can reach it

00:28.470 --> 00:31.590
and that is the idea during development of course.

00:31.680 --> 00:38.490
Now in this module, we'll move from development to production and you will learn how we can prepare

00:38.490 --> 00:40.480
our project for deployment.

00:40.590 --> 00:46.350
There are some things we just want to adjust or where we want to make sure that we don't skip them.

00:46.680 --> 00:53.190
We'll then of course also walk through all the important steps and the configuration you need to do to

00:53.220 --> 00:56.110
deploy your project to a hosting provider

00:56.370 --> 01:03.600
and we'll talk about security because that obviously is connected to deploying your app because as soon

01:03.600 --> 01:09.600
as it does not run on your own computer anymore, you obviously have to make sure that some things just

01:09.600 --> 01:11.240
are, well secure.

01:11.520 --> 01:14.390
So let's dive into all these things in this module.
