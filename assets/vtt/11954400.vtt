00:02.080 --> 00:08.240
In this module, I now want to give you an introduction to how you can send e-mails from inside your node

00:08.300 --> 00:15.630
application. Obviously sending emails is a crucial task in many web applications and in our website here,

00:15.800 --> 00:22.940
we could want to send an e-mail after a user signed up for example to confirm the sign up, something like

00:22.940 --> 00:23.870
that.

00:23.970 --> 00:24.240
Now for that

00:24.260 --> 00:29.930
I will show you how that works, what sending e-mails in a node application actually means and which part

00:30.150 --> 00:36.170
nodjs and expressjs play in that big picture and we'll then implement it. We'll then implement

00:36.170 --> 00:40.060
a package that helps us sending e-mails and we'll send an e-mail

00:40.070 --> 00:42.060
upon successful sign up.

00:42.060 --> 00:44.060
So let's work on this in this module.
