00:02.080 --> 00:04.130
So how can we add authorization?

00:04.900 --> 00:10.720
I want to ensure that I can't delete or edit this book with or this product with the wrong account.

00:10.720 --> 00:13.380
Now we do have important information stored on the product,

00:13.420 --> 00:15.990
we know which user did create it,

00:16.120 --> 00:22.780
so in the end we just want to check if the currently logged in user is the user who created that before

00:22.840 --> 00:25.830
allowing any edits to that item.

00:25.990 --> 00:33.550
And that means that on the admin controller where we render our admin list here, get products here,

00:33.760 --> 00:39.790
I only want to render products that were created by the logged in user because there is no sense in

00:39.790 --> 00:46.520
showing products on this page that were not created by the user because we're in the admin section,

00:46.590 --> 00:49.720
you are not able to do anything with it if you weren't a creator.

00:49.810 --> 00:56.080
So authorization simply means we restrict the permissions and we can do that by restricting the data

00:56.080 --> 00:57.590
we return for example,

00:57.640 --> 01:05.770
so here when I find product, I dont find all but I'll add a filter and I'll filter for products where the

01:05.770 --> 01:13.480
user ID is equal to the user id of the currently logged in user, so user ID is equal to request user

01:13.660 --> 01:15.720
id, whoops, ID

01:16.090 --> 01:23.420
and keep in mind request user exists because we do extract that user in app.js in a separate middleware

01:23.470 --> 01:25.030
here, there

01:25.030 --> 01:27.130
I do store the user in request

01:27.140 --> 01:38.070
user, so I know that only products which were created by that user should be retrieved. With that changed

01:38.080 --> 01:47.760
if I reload this page, I find no products for test2 but if I do login with my other account with

01:47.760 --> 01:51.960
test@test.com and I go to admin products, I do find that book,

01:52.090 --> 01:54.920
so that is the first important step forward.

01:55.000 --> 02:00.250
The problem is I could theoretically still issue requests behind the scenes where I do try to delete

02:00.250 --> 02:02.070
a product which was not created by me,

02:02.170 --> 02:04.200
so more protection is needed.

02:04.210 --> 02:05.590
Let's add that next.
