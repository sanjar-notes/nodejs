So let's dive back into our project and make sure you are logged out and make sure you download the attached

00:09.970 --> 00:16.410
snapshot because there I did add a sign up link to our navigation bar and if we click on that,

00:16.450 --> 00:21.610
we also load a sign up page where we should edit the caption of the button by the way.

00:21.670 --> 00:27.020
So if you download the attached code, what was added and you can also add this to your own project.

00:27.160 --> 00:33.730
I did add the sign up.ejs file where I also should change this to sign up, so you can simply add that file

00:33.730 --> 00:35.700
to your auth folder.

00:35.800 --> 00:43.150
I did manipulate or change the navigation.ejs file, there what I did add is I simply added the sign

00:43.150 --> 00:45.610
up navigation menu entry

00:45.640 --> 00:51.130
after login, both for the normal menu and also for the mobile menu down there,

00:51.130 --> 00:54.230
so basically one list item was added to each menu,

00:54.640 --> 00:56.460
this is what I added in this file.

00:56.740 --> 01:02.980
And then I worked on my routes, there I added two new routes, posts sign up and get sign up where I use

01:02.980 --> 01:06.610
my auth controller get sign up and post sign up actions

01:06.790 --> 01:09.830
and in that controller, I worked on these actions.

01:09.880 --> 01:13.300
I added posts sign up which is an empty placeholder, nothing in there,

01:13.510 --> 01:18.370
so that is not that difficult, get sign up also is is a pretty simple route, there

01:18.400 --> 01:20.010
I simply render the auth

01:20.050 --> 01:26.170
sign up view. So you can just add this to your existing project or use my attached snapshot and replace

01:26.170 --> 01:29.210
my mongodb url with yours

01:29.230 --> 01:34.820
and once you got all that, you should be able to have a running application that looks like this with

01:34.820 --> 01:40.950
a sign up page that looks like this because now we will use or we will need a way of signing up users.

01:41.000 --> 01:45.530
So let's now start implementing the full authentication flow in this module

01:45.550 --> 01:51.260
and for that, we'll first of all make sure that we can create new users, then that we can sign users in and

01:51.260 --> 01:57.190
sign users out of course, that we can then use the information whether a user is signed

01:57.200 --> 02:03.380
in or signed out in all our views and that we can protect our routes on the server side too because

02:03.380 --> 02:09.650
right now even if I'm not signed in, what I can do is I can manually visit admin add product and this

02:09.650 --> 02:10.310
works.

02:10.460 --> 02:15.680
So I can't get there by menu because we hide the menu options but manually visiting this works

02:15.680 --> 02:18.660
and this is also something we'll work on in this module.

02:18.740 --> 02:23.620
So let's get there step by step and let's start by adding user sign up in the next lecture.
