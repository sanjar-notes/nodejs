Before we work on the styling, let me add one note on how we navigate it to the root folder in shop.js

00:09.290 --> 00:10.540
and admin.js.

00:10.700 --> 00:17.200
For one you could just use dot dot here instead of dot dot slash and this would be preferable

00:17.210 --> 00:22.890
even though both should work on Windows and Mac because now we make no assumption about the separator

00:22.910 --> 00:25.180
we're using when constructing a path.

00:25.190 --> 00:33.030
So with this, if I go back and I now go to just admin add product here, it still works

00:33.110 --> 00:35.340
but now we get a cleaner way of doing this

00:35.570 --> 00:38.950
but there is an even nicer way we could implement this.

00:38.990 --> 00:45.490
We could also get the parent directory with the help of a little helper function.

00:45.740 --> 00:50.070
For this I'll create a new folder here, helpers or util,

00:50.120 --> 00:52.410
I'll go with util, you can name it however you want

00:52.670 --> 00:56.920
and there I'll add my path.js file

00:56.950 --> 01:01.770
and it doesn't matter that this clashes with the global module because we'll import it differently

01:01.790 --> 01:08.930
anyways. Now there, I'll add an export with module exports and I want to export a little function that

01:08.930 --> 01:15.960
helps me construct a path to the parent directory or not a real function, instead a

01:16.260 --> 01:24.530
variable I should say. First of all here, I'll import the path with require path as we did it before and

01:24.530 --> 01:28.640
then I will use a different function here, not join

01:28.760 --> 01:34.580
but dir name. Dir name as you can see in their quick help on the right here returns the directory

01:34.580 --> 01:36.430
name of a path,

01:36.440 --> 01:44.210
so this sounds pretty useful, if we use that we just have to find out which directory or for which file

01:44.210 --> 01:45.870
we want to get the directory name.

01:46.250 --> 01:49.080
Well there we can use the global process variable,

01:49.100 --> 01:52.490
that is also a variable that is available in all files,

01:52.490 --> 01:53.700
you don't need to import it

01:54.020 --> 01:57.260
and there you will have a main module property.

01:57.320 --> 02:02.510
This will refer to the main, well module that started your application,

02:02.510 --> 02:09.680
so basically to the module we created here in app.js and now we can call file name to find out in

02:09.680 --> 02:12.460
which file this module was spun up.

02:12.470 --> 02:19.190
So put in other words, this gives us the path to the file that is responsible for the fact that our application

02:19.190 --> 02:26.110
is running and this file name is what we put into dir name to get a path to that directory.

02:26.420 --> 02:30.000
With this we can import from this file, here

02:30.020 --> 02:35.880
I'll add my own import separated from the other ones simply to make it easier to identify and I'll name

02:35.940 --> 02:37.200
this root 

02:37.320 --> 02:37.910
dir,

02:37.910 --> 02:44.990
the name is totally up to you but I will require this from going up one level into util and then path

02:45.590 --> 02:48.410
and this root directory is in the end

02:48.410 --> 02:51.980
what I want to inject here. So root directory is what I'll start with

02:51.980 --> 02:53.970
when creating this path.

02:54.290 --> 03:00.680
And now let's try reloading this page here and it still works and it should still work because now we're

03:00.680 --> 03:06.250
in the end having a pretty neat way of constructing a path to our root directory.

03:06.260 --> 03:08.100
I'll do the same in shop.js,

03:08.240 --> 03:16.480
import root dir from the util folder and the path file in there and replace dir name dot dot with root dir.

03:17.170 --> 03:17.780
Again

03:17.810 --> 03:23.600
you could have totally sticked to the old approach but this one is a even cleaner one and one that should

03:23.600 --> 03:29.510
be pretty straightforward to use and that should work on all operating systems and it always gives you

03:29.600 --> 03:33.080
well the path to the root file.

03:33.080 --> 03:35.480
With that, let's move on to the styling.
