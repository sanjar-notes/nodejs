Now that we learned some new tricks regarding how we can send mails,

00:06.200 --> 00:13.550
let's use that new knowledge to improve our authentication features and in general, let's improve our

00:13.550 --> 00:21.710
security or the authentication related things in our app. For example let's also work on ensuring that

00:21.770 --> 00:24.770
only users who created a post can edit it

00:24.800 --> 00:28.180
but let's start with resetting passwords. To be precise

00:28.180 --> 00:32.210
in this module, we'll start with resetting passwords but then we'll have a look at

00:32.220 --> 00:33.240
authorization

00:33.290 --> 00:39.620
which is that part I just talked about with ensuring that you can only edit and delete what you created.
