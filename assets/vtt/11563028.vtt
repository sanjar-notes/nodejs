The next category are runtime errors and a great example for this can be shown with the res write method

00:09.750 --> 00:10.630
here.

00:10.760 --> 00:19.600
Now as I mentioned, you have to return here to prevent the execution of the code after this statement

00:19.630 --> 00:23.510
otherwise and this is something node specific of course, you would

00:23.690 --> 00:27.400
end a request here but the code execution would continue

00:27.560 --> 00:31.570
and eventually we would reach this line and this is no syntax error,

00:31.570 --> 00:36.390
this is correct but if we run our code here, seems to work right,

00:36.440 --> 00:38.710
there is no syntax error after all.

00:38.870 --> 00:44.480
But if we now visit our page, eventually it breaks here and this is the point where it should go back

00:44.480 --> 00:51.080
to your code and should find an error message there too. And this error message is something you

00:51.080 --> 00:57.740
shouldn't just take and paste into the Q & A section but actually read it.

00:57.740 --> 01:00.800
A lot of the error messages are indeed helpful,

01:00.800 --> 01:04.100
you just need to know how to read them, at the bottom

01:04.100 --> 01:10.310
you always find uninteresting stuff I'd say but you have to scroll to the top of the error message and

01:10.310 --> 01:13.130
all of a sudden, it should get more meaningful.

01:13.130 --> 01:19.910
For example here, you see the error code which already indicates that it's something with headers being

01:19.910 --> 01:27.250
sent and then here, you actually find a detailed error message, cannot set headers after they are set

01:27.290 --> 01:34.100
to the client and then you see that it was caused by a call to set header and unfortunately, the line

01:34.100 --> 01:36.500
numbers don't help you, here at least

01:36.590 --> 01:38.310
but then it does help you here,

01:38.480 --> 01:45.080
you see it's in the request handler and there it points at the routes.js file line 32. And now this is the

01:45.080 --> 01:46.630
point where you can dive in and see,

01:46.670 --> 01:48.640
ok I'm calling set header here,

01:48.740 --> 01:54.100
now since it's complaining that I can't set them after they are sent to the client,

01:54.170 --> 02:00.230
I should look well in the code before this statement because it looks like I'm finishing my response

02:00.230 --> 02:08.810
there for this example. And indeed at some point you should find this statement and see I do actually

02:08.900 --> 02:15.110
not finish my code execution after this statement which is not per se a problem but it becomes a problem

02:15.370 --> 02:20.870
if in the following code, I then work on my response again as I'm doing it here.

02:20.900 --> 02:28.130
So now this is the point where we can fix this by stopping the code execution or by wrapping this in an

02:28.160 --> 02:31.520
extra if statement which is guaranteed to not run

02:31.640 --> 02:37.690
if we make it into this statement. And now with that, we can of course restart our server

02:37.700 --> 02:39.310
or actually we don't need to,

02:39.380 --> 02:42.060
we got nodemon now so you don't need to do that

02:42.100 --> 02:44.860
and now if you reload your page, it will work again.
