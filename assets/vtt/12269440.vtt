WEBVTT

00:02.110 --> 00:08.580
In this course, you obviously learned a lot about node and how to write node code and build web servers

00:08.610 --> 00:13.450
or web applications with node because that really is its main thing.

00:13.820 --> 00:22.770
But node and npm, the package manager we get for free when installing nodejs can also be used as a build

00:22.800 --> 00:23.460
tool,

00:23.460 --> 00:31.650
so as a tool that runs utility scripts on your computer and can help you with building, any mostly javascript

00:31.680 --> 00:38.820
driven project and that does not have to be a web application or a server side web application if it

00:38.820 --> 00:41.970
is one, it could be a frontend web application too

00:41.970 --> 00:49.080
like the react app we had in this course, the frontend for the rest and the graphql API. And in this

00:49.080 --> 00:56.010
module we'll briefly dive into that and I'll explain why that is the case, what exactly npm is and how

00:56.010 --> 00:59.260
we can use it and how we can use node as a build tool.
