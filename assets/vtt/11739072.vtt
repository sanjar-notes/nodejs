00:02.490 --> 00:10.500
That's it for the SQL part of this course. You learned about SQL, that it's a database philosophy or

00:10.510 --> 00:19.350
schema engine type that uses strict data schemas and relations in the databases that use SQL and

00:19.350 --> 00:27.840
that you can easily connect to such databases with nodejs, with packages like MySQL too. There we

00:27.840 --> 00:30.600
had to write all the SQL queries manually though

00:30.720 --> 00:36.000
and you also have to configure the database manually, add tables manually, set up relations and that is

00:36.000 --> 00:38.880
a lot of work and definitely something you need to learn

00:38.880 --> 00:43.230
in addition to nodejs, it's its own language essentially

00:43.230 --> 00:50.100
or you use packages like sequelize. Sequelize allows you to not write SQL queries but instead interact

00:50.100 --> 00:58.020
with your database through models you define and not just models but also relations, so-called associations

00:58.140 --> 00:59.670
in the sequelize world.

01:00.030 --> 01:05.850
That gives you a lot of magic methods that allow you to easily connect data, add data, delete data,

01:05.880 --> 01:08.320
basically what you saw in this module.

01:08.640 --> 01:13.200
Now you could easily create an entire course just about SQL and sequelize

01:13.290 --> 01:18.500
and that is not what this course is, it's the complete node course, not the complete sequelize

01:18.510 --> 01:24.780
course. I strongly encourage you to dive into the sequelize docs if you plan on continuing with that to

01:24.830 --> 01:31.650
learn all the ins and outs of this package and simply play around with it, build your own demo applications

01:31.890 --> 01:36.760
and try out the different features, different types of relations and so on.

01:36.980 --> 01:44.310
We'll move on here and we'll learn about a different way of storing data with a NoSQL approach in mongodb.

01:44.450 --> 01:47.250
This is what we'll dive into in the next modules.
