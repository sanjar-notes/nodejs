That's it for this module. You learned about the important MVC pattern and there the model serves the purpose

00:10.240 --> 00:17.320
of representing our data and of managing our data, saving it, fetching it, later also updating it and so

00:17.320 --> 00:22.200
on. And it doesn't matter if you manage your data in memory, files or databases,

00:22.300 --> 00:25.490
it is the model which is responsible for your data,

00:25.540 --> 00:27.850
it contains all the data related logic.

00:28.330 --> 00:33.940
The view on the other hand is responsible for presenting it to the user, is responsible for what the

00:33.940 --> 00:39.790
user sees and it shouldn't contain too much logic which might remind you of the handlebars templating

00:39.790 --> 00:46.470
engine which kind of forced you to not put too much logic into there. With ejs, the templating engine

00:46.480 --> 00:47.540
I'm using here,

00:47.680 --> 00:54.370
you can put more logic into the view and you should always well try to find your own personal balance.

00:54.370 --> 00:59.830
Some people want to have a super pure approach, other people like me are fine with a little bit of logic

00:59.890 --> 01:03.760
in the templates but you should definitely not put too much in there,

01:03.760 --> 01:10.900
your logic should be in the model or partly in the controller because the controller should do everything

01:10.960 --> 01:14.670
that needs to be done to connect your model and the view,

01:14.740 --> 01:21.800
so to get the data from A to B and that can involve both directions. It can mean that through your view,

01:21.820 --> 01:22.870
through a form,

01:22.900 --> 01:29.500
some data was sent to your node express application and you now need to send that to the model to save it

01:29.530 --> 01:30.070
there

01:30.280 --> 01:36.520
or it can of course mean you're fetching data from the model or via the model and send that into a view

01:36.580 --> 01:38.940
which is then returned to the user.

01:38.950 --> 01:45.310
This is the MVC pattern and I will continue to work with that for the rest of this project here or for the

01:45.310 --> 01:51.580
next modules put in other words and speaking of that, our module still can use some work right,

01:51.610 --> 01:56.160
we're only working with a very limited set of features,

01:56.230 --> 02:00.980
even our product is just one field for now and we can certainly do better.

02:01.150 --> 02:07.450
So the whole next module will be on working on our project and therefore practicing all the things we

02:07.460 --> 02:08.480
learned thus far

02:08.590 --> 02:09.760
and of course no worries,

02:09.760 --> 02:12.070
we'll then also add databases and so on,

02:12.070 --> 02:13.060
that is all coming.
