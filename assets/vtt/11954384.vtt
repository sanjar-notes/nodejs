I'm outputting that error message, I just want to style it a little bit now

00:06.150 --> 00:13.790
and for that I'll give it a css class and I'll simply name that user message and then maybe user

00:14.580 --> 00:18.910
message --error using some BEM styling here,

00:18.930 --> 00:25.250
that's a css styling convention or a convention of naming your classes. Doesn't matter too much,

00:25.250 --> 00:26.790
you can name this whatever you want in the end,

00:26.790 --> 00:32.430
I added these two classes, one to have a general message look and then one for errors because maybe we

00:32.430 --> 00:35.850
also want to be able to output success messages later.

00:35.850 --> 00:42.770
So with that, let me quickly add this to some css files and you can skip this lecture if you want,

00:42.780 --> 00:47.400
in the next lecture you find the finished code attached which you can use. In the main css, I'll

00:47.460 --> 00:51.320
quickly add this, let's say at the bottom of this file,

00:51.360 --> 00:56.280
it's up to you right before the media query maybe, I have my user message, 

00:56.290 --> 00:59.060
so this css class I just added here

01:00.040 --> 01:09.400
and let's say such a user message should use a margin auto to be centered, get a width of 90%

01:09.430 --> 01:10.600
by default,

01:10.590 --> 01:14.720
I'll also set up some styling in case I'm on a bigger screen,

01:14.970 --> 01:25.400
there user message will have a width of let's say 30rem and then here I'll give it a border of one

01:25.400 --> 01:32.540
pixel solid and let's use maybe some bluish color here, maybe not that blue,

01:33.870 --> 01:42.540
well basically which ever blue color you want, maybe this one and a background color,

01:42.600 --> 01:49.580
I'll also use a blue here, also a different blue, so some light bluish color here

01:49.590 --> 01:55.290
so the general info message should have maybe some neutral color, so some blue like this

01:55.430 --> 01:57.000
and let's see how that looks like.

01:58.280 --> 02:03.470
With it added, let me try entering an invalid email again,

02:03.470 --> 02:04.210
looks like that,

02:04.250 --> 02:06.280
well not too pretty,

02:06.290 --> 02:09.150
that should be much lighter.

02:09.350 --> 02:13.420
I also want to have some padding in here,

02:13.420 --> 02:20.120
maybe 1rem and let's give it some rounded corners as well and

02:20.130 --> 02:24.860
now with that, if we enter an invalid email that looks much better.

02:25.200 --> 02:30.780
Ok so now this is my general info message, let's also maybe also center the text if we want to

02:30.780 --> 02:38.490
and now let's give this an error version basically with --error, that's the other class I added to this specific

02:38.490 --> 02:46.620
box in my login screen and there I will change the border color to be red and the background should

02:46.620 --> 02:47.870
be a light red,

02:48.000 --> 02:52.970
so let's start with red and then turn this into a light red

02:53.340 --> 03:02.460
and now if we try this again, now it looks like this. Ok so this could be the error message we're outputting

03:02.460 --> 03:02.850
here,

03:02.850 --> 03:08.310
you could also turn the text red if you want, so you could also say text color should be red here maybe

03:08.850 --> 03:12.560
and reduce the padding maybe to .5, that could look a bit better,

03:14.570 --> 03:16.160
so an invalid email or password,

03:16.160 --> 03:17.150
that looks good.

03:17.150 --> 03:19.580
Now I always have that stickaround

03:19.580 --> 03:22.420
now, reason for that is if I go back,

03:22.700 --> 03:29.240
error message seems to be set to something even if we're not having a message in there and that is something

03:29.240 --> 03:30.620
I'll check in the next lecture.
