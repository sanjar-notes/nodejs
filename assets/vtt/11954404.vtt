00:02.230 --> 00:03.980
So in this course, I will use sendgrid

00:04.000 --> 00:10.540
you'll find it on sendgrid.com and I'll use it because they have a free entry tier which

00:10.540 --> 00:13.840
stays free as long as you send less than 100 e-mails a day.

00:13.840 --> 00:22.000
Now there are many alternatives, MailChimp, AWS, SCS and you can google for nodemailing and your favorite

00:22.630 --> 00:25.590
mailing service to find tutorials on how to implement it,

00:25.600 --> 00:28.440
now I will use this one because we can use it for free.

00:28.780 --> 00:33.760
So let's click try for free and then we simply have to create an account there.

00:33.790 --> 00:39.820
Now once you did sign up, you can quit that page here and go back to your node project and there we'll

00:39.820 --> 00:46.560
now install a package. I'll install a package with npm install --save which is called node

00:46.680 --> 00:50.350
mailer and to interact with sendgrid,

00:50.550 --> 00:57.320
I'll also install another package in the same go, nodemailer-sendgrid-transport,

00:57.390 --> 01:02.280
that is a package that will help us with integrating sendgrid and conveniently use that together with

01:02.280 --> 01:09.380
nodemailer. Nodemailer is a package that as the name suggests, makes sending emails from inside

01:09.390 --> 01:14.060
nodejs a breeze. With that all added,

01:14.150 --> 01:19.190
we can move on to the next lecture and now start using nodemailer to send messages.

01:19.190 --> 01:20.600
So let me start that server again and

01:20.630 --> 01:22.190
let's continue in the next lecture.
