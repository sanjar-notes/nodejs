00:02.290 --> 00:05.400
Now we added that file storage logic to our model,

00:05.450 --> 00:10.790
let's now fix this a little bit or improve the code in the model, we're reusing some code

00:10.840 --> 00:20.260
and if we reuse code that always screams for some refactoring and indeed, that is what I want to do. I

00:20.260 --> 00:29.880
will create a helper function and I'll store it in a constant and I'll name that helper function get products

00:29.940 --> 00:35.360
from file and this helper function will do this

00:35.360 --> 00:39.120
path construction here for me and it will also read the file,

00:39.120 --> 00:47.300
so it will basically do everything I do here in fetch all, like this and I will even get my callback here

00:48.360 --> 00:53.760
because I do execute that here and ultimately return this because the issue of this process taking

00:53.760 --> 01:00.150
some time and the need to inform the caller of this function about when it's done hasn't gone away.

01:00.180 --> 01:05.850
So I still use the same pattern of having this helper function which receives a callback which it executes

01:06.030 --> 01:07.920
once it's done reading the file.

01:08.280 --> 01:14.740
With this, get products from file is really just all I execute here in fetch all,

01:14.850 --> 01:21.210
so I simply just call this and forward the callback.

01:21.400 --> 01:28.860
Now for save however, it means that here I can also call get products from file

01:29.170 --> 01:34.500
but here I don't forward any callback because instead I have my own logic here,

01:34.600 --> 01:39.640
I do retrieve my products there and that's essentially the same logic I do have in get products from

01:39.640 --> 01:44.670
file, I either return an empty array if I have an error or I parse my content,

01:44.830 --> 01:46.100
here we did it the other way around

01:46.210 --> 01:49.040
but in the end it will result in the same result.

01:49.390 --> 01:51.490
So I'm only interested in this logic here

01:51.490 --> 01:57.200
then, you can remove that and instead just take this code here

01:58.800 --> 02:04.650
and then create a new anonymous function where I know that I will get my products because this again

02:05.040 --> 02:06.690
is the callback function,

02:06.690 --> 02:10.580
it is the function I will pass as an argument to get products from file,

02:10.590 --> 02:13.070
so it is what will get called here.

02:13.260 --> 02:19.350
So this function will get called in, will receive an empty array or the array with the data and I should

02:19.350 --> 02:24.840
by the way add a return statement here to make sure that we never execute this code after having executed

02:24.840 --> 02:25.740
this code,

02:25.740 --> 02:29.020
that was an error we had in the code before.

02:29.020 --> 02:34.970
Alternatively you simply wrap the other code in a else statement, either of the two,

02:34.990 --> 02:36.900
so here I'll use the if else approach.

02:37.090 --> 02:41.530
But now with that the callback will get executed and will get this array of products

02:41.860 --> 02:49.270
and now here in save, I do have this anonymous function which receives the products and in this anonymous

02:49.270 --> 02:49.930
function,

02:49.930 --> 02:56.320
I will then put in my code where I append a new product and make sure to always use arrow functions so

02:56.320 --> 03:03.970
that this never loses its context and always refers to the class and therefore to the object based

03:03.970 --> 03:05.190
on the class

03:05.410 --> 03:07.660
and then I write to the file,

03:07.660 --> 03:09.950
this means I can get rid of this line too.

03:10.030 --> 03:16.110
And now we get a slimmer version because we're reusing code but it still should work if I reload here,

03:16.240 --> 03:18.310
loading product seems to work

03:18.610 --> 03:27.730
and if I add a second book even though it's the fourth one, this crashes because p is not defined. Yeah

03:27.800 --> 03:33.200
the path here in save, that is a problem the path is not defined

03:34.680 --> 03:38.560
because I'm only defining it in my helper function now.

03:38.570 --> 03:41.090
Now there are various ways of fixing that,

03:41.360 --> 03:48.410
one of the easier ways is to simply create this as a global helper constant here, p so that I can

03:48.410 --> 03:54.130
use it in the entire file, you can of course also go for different solutions and pass it around in the functions

03:54.260 --> 03:59.760
but now the path should be available in the save method and in get products from file.

03:59.830 --> 04:08.090
And with that if I now reload and try this second, actually fourth book again, 

04:08.260 --> 04:10.180
this now works.

04:10.180 --> 04:16.240
So now we are able to elegantly work with our products, store them in a file, fetch them from there

04:16.360 --> 04:18.580
and all of that through a model.

04:18.580 --> 04:23.080
And that is the MVC pattern implemented into our project.
