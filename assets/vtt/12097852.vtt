00:02.040 --> 00:09.450
So time to dive deeper into your rest APIs and build a complete project or a complete back end for a

00:09.450 --> 00:11.700
project as a rest API.

00:11.850 --> 00:16.860
And in this project, we'll have a look at things like authentication and other interesting things like

00:16.860 --> 00:18.410
image upload and so on.

00:18.420 --> 00:20.460
So what's in this module in detail?

00:20.460 --> 00:28.110
We'll plan our rest API or I'll show you the project for which we'll need one and we'll then build it

00:28.110 --> 00:29.190
together, of course.

00:29.190 --> 00:34.740
So in detail we will implement all the CRUD operations our project needs.

00:34.740 --> 00:39.780
So creating, reading, updating and deleting items in the database and so on.

00:39.810 --> 00:41.010
That is what we'll do here.

00:41.010 --> 00:45.090
We'll define all the rest API endpoints for this and so on.

00:45.150 --> 00:52.230
We'll add validation on the server side to make sure that only valid data gets stored in our database.

00:52.230 --> 00:59.640
We'll add image upload so that we still can store images even though we're not rendering views anymore.

00:59.640 --> 01:05.970
And finally, I'll also dive into authentication, which will be very important and very interesting

01:06.000 --> 01:06.600
too.

01:06.750 --> 01:07.950
So let's dive in.
