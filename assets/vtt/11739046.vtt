00:02.540 --> 00:08.420
To work with our new cart let's go to the controllers folder here and there to the shop.js file which

00:08.420 --> 00:16.580
is where we have our cart related actions. Get products get product, get index, that is all working, get

00:16.580 --> 00:18.980
cart however will not work.

00:20.200 --> 00:31.510
In there, I want to use the cart associated with my existing user to get all the products in it and render

00:31.510 --> 00:33.120
them to the screen.

00:33.670 --> 00:41.620
For this, let's get rid of that code but I'll comment it out so that I easily can use my render function

00:41.620 --> 00:42.240
again and

00:43.470 --> 00:50.060
let's use request user, that's still the user stored in our request. By the way one important adjustment,

00:50.090 --> 00:57.150
let's disable that force syncing again so that we don't always override any data we stored.

00:57.170 --> 01:02.870
So let's go back to app.js, to shop.js excuse me and let's use the user we retrieve for every new

01:02.870 --> 01:07.070
request and which we store in the request and there,

01:07.250 --> 01:14.130
let's execute cart and let's look into this and see if this gives us anything meaningful.

01:15.870 --> 01:21.690
If I now save this and I go to cart, it doesn't load the page

01:22.000 --> 01:23.900
and if I go back we see undefined here,

01:23.950 --> 01:26.130
so we can't access the cart like this.

01:26.530 --> 01:34.970
But what we can do here is we can use our request user and get the cart which is associated to it. Let's

01:34.970 --> 01:36.440
add then and catch,

01:41.220 --> 01:45.300
here we'll get the cart and let's log the cart here.

01:46.750 --> 01:53.070
If we save that and I reload this page, it still will not load

01:53.190 --> 01:57.010
but now I get null here and not undefined.

01:57.020 --> 02:02.270
Now the reason why we don't find anything here for either of the two approaches is that we got no carts

02:02.280 --> 02:02.760
yet,

02:03.000 --> 02:09.720
if we look into our database, carts is totally empty. Just as we create a user right at startup,

02:09.810 --> 02:14.740
I'll create a cart for that user, so here I create a user.

02:14.950 --> 02:23.490
Now in the next step where I get that user, I will also create a cart by adding user create cart, like this 

02:26.900 --> 02:32.390
and I don't need to pass any data in there because cart in the beginning will not hold any special

02:32.390 --> 02:34.930
data, it just needs to be there.

02:35.110 --> 02:40.290
I'll then return this and only listen in the next step

02:41.300 --> 02:42.550
where I get my cart

02:42.560 --> 02:53.140
so to say and with this now set up, you see an insert into carts call is done here. If we now have a look into

02:53.140 --> 02:54.110
our carts,

02:54.280 --> 03:02.250
we see now we get a cart associated to our user with the ID 1 and now if I try to reload that carts

03:02.250 --> 03:13.230
page again, here we now get some output and this output is stemming from our get cart call here,

03:13.490 --> 03:16.120
so from this console log where I do log that cart,

03:16.200 --> 03:20.630
so now this is working. Now for completeness sake,

03:20.630 --> 03:24.910
let's also console log request user cart

03:24.920 --> 03:28.370
again, does this also work?

03:28.560 --> 03:33.290
If I reload here, this still is the old log

03:33.370 --> 03:36.590
but if I scroll above it, we still see undefined.

03:36.610 --> 03:44.170
So this does not work, we can't access cart as a property here but we can call get cart to work with the

03:44.170 --> 03:45.570
cart.

03:45.610 --> 03:49.630
So now we've got the cart available, we loaded the cart from the database,

03:49.630 --> 03:55.680
we know more about that cart here. With the cart available,

03:55.840 --> 04:02.320
we can use it to fetch the products that are inside of it by returning carts get products.

04:02.440 --> 04:11.220
Remember a cart is associated to products in our app.js file through belongs to many and sequelize

04:11.230 --> 04:14.710
will do the magic of looking into cart item and so on,

04:14.710 --> 04:15.900
so into this

04:16.550 --> 04:24.270
in-between table. So we can get products, this was added by sequelize as a magic method

04:25.510 --> 04:30.780
and therefore here in this then block, we'll have products available

04:30.990 --> 04:34.230
and here I'll again just log any error I get.

04:34.370 --> 04:40.720
But in the then block here, we should have the products that are in this cart and that of course means that

04:40.720 --> 04:43.750
we can now render these products.

04:43.750 --> 04:45.520
So here I will render

04:48.430 --> 04:50.620
my products here,

04:50.890 --> 04:54.250
store them in products and pass them to the view.

04:54.270 --> 04:57.190
Now this will not work as expected though,

04:57.310 --> 05:01.050
if I now reload this page, we see no products in cart.

05:01.150 --> 05:06.850
Now we got no products in a cart but we'll see that later once we do have them, it'll also not work but

05:06.850 --> 05:08.230
I'll come back to that,

05:08.260 --> 05:12.090
for now let's just have a look at our query statement.

05:12.100 --> 05:15.990
We can see that this is the statement executed by sequelize

05:16.270 --> 05:21.910
and if you didn't see it before, here we can definitely see the advantage we have by using a package

05:21.910 --> 05:22.690
like this.

05:22.690 --> 05:25.490
We don't have to write that SQL statement on our own,

05:25.540 --> 05:29.560
we use sequelize and let it do that behind the scenes.

05:29.560 --> 05:35.440
So before I come back to what we will have to do regarding getting the cart products, let's make sure

05:35.590 --> 05:37.630
we can add products to the cart.

05:37.780 --> 05:44.380
So for now I'll get rid of all that logic here and I will focus on adding products to the cart in the

05:44.380 --> 05:45.070
next step.
