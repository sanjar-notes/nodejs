In this module we had a look at some advanced authentication related topics, namely we had a look at

00:08.930 --> 00:15.140
password resetting and there it was important to understand that you of course have to implement password

00:15.140 --> 00:20.170
resetting in a way that prevents users from resetting random user accounts.

00:20.170 --> 00:26.780
Therefore we implemented such a short lived password token so that it's not valid forever

00:26.900 --> 00:34.880
to reduce the chance of it being generated by some brute force attack and therefore, our reset token

00:35.120 --> 00:41.840
is a great mechanism to identify the user for whom we want to reset the password. The token has to be

00:41.840 --> 00:45.110
generated in a way that is random,

00:45.110 --> 00:49.050
unguessable, at least in a reasonable amount of time

00:49.070 --> 00:51.680
hence the expiration date and unique

00:51.860 --> 00:56.390
and in this module, we implemented a token in exactly that way.

00:56.390 --> 01:03.110
We also had a look at authorization and authorization is all about locking down access for authenticated

01:03.110 --> 01:09.020
users because just because you're authenticated, you're not allowed to do everything. You might be logged

01:09.020 --> 01:13.910
in in your udemy account but you can't edit my course because you are not the creator of the

01:13.910 --> 01:20.240
course and that's the idea of authorization and that is also what we did in this module when we ensured

01:20.450 --> 01:26.550
that only users who created a product can actually view, edit and delete it.

01:26.900 --> 01:30.380
So authorization is a crucial part of most applications

01:30.440 --> 01:36.950
and together with authentication which is the surrounding topic of having users in general, you can really

01:36.950 --> 01:43.560
control which visitor can do what in your web app in your website.
