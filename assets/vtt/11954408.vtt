00:02.130 --> 00:08.790
So in this module I showed you how to send mails with nodemailer and in this case, the sendgrid third party

00:08.790 --> 00:09.760
service.

00:09.780 --> 00:17.070
Now one thing I also want to highlight is the way we send that an e-mail here works for our app and it's

00:17.070 --> 00:23.160
good that we don't block the redirect but that we redirect and send the mail at the same time because

00:23.160 --> 00:28.770
if you have an application with a lot of requests and you would wait for the email to be sent before you

00:28.770 --> 00:29.430
redirect,

00:29.430 --> 00:34.160
you might slow down your application because you're sending a lot of e-mails.

00:34.350 --> 00:40.470
Now depending on the size of your app and now we're talking about really huge apps, you could also look

00:40.470 --> 00:42.410
into totally different approaches

00:42.440 --> 00:49.110
where you have some server side scripts running every x hours or every x minutes that send e-mails to

00:49.110 --> 00:50.750
newly signed up users.

00:50.760 --> 00:56.880
Now this will only matter from a certain scale of app on and there you have different problems anyways

00:56.970 --> 01:03.060
but I just want to highlight that you should strongly consider not using this in a blocking way because

01:03.120 --> 01:09.720
if you wait for this to be finished, this can be slow and you have to evaluate if it's worth waiting for

01:09.720 --> 01:14.660
this or if your user can continue even without that mail being delivered.

01:14.670 --> 01:16.780
Now with that, you learn how to send mails,

01:16.830 --> 01:18.920
not that difficult as you can tell.

01:18.930 --> 01:25.560
Now let's use that knowledge in the next module and enhance our authentication process or our authentication

01:25.560 --> 01:26.640
features we offer.
