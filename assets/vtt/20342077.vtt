<v Instructor>I wanna start with ES Modules.</v>

2
00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:07.640
What are ES Modules?

3
00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:09.080
Well, in the end, it's a concept

4
00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:12.420
coming from the browser side JavaScript code.

5
00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:15.740
There we can also import and export files.

6
00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:19.190
And it's relatively new that we can do that there.

7
00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:21.690
Six years ago, that wasn't really a thing

8
00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:23.090
in the browser side.

9
00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:25.480
But now, we can import and export there,

10
00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:27.970
and in modern JavaScript in the browser,

11
00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:31.390
the import/export syntax does not look like

12
00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:34.050
the syntax we use in Node JS.

13
00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.220
Instead, in the browser, we export something

14
00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:40.510
from one file to another file, with this syntax,

15
00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:45.510
and we then import it in that other file with this syntax.

16
00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:48.520
Now there are various variations

17
00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:50.930
of this import/export syntax,

18
00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:53.800
and in my "JavaScript, the Complete Guide" course,

19
00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:55.490
you can learn all about that.

20
00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:58.630
It's all about JavaScript, and it therefore covers

21
00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:02.350
all JavaScript features, including this ES module

22
00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:05.810
import/export syntax in all different variations

23
00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:07.023
you can learn it.

24
00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:11.920
In addition, if you Google for Node ES modules,

25
00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:15.210
you will also find the official Node.js documentation

26
00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.190
for ES modules, and there you can also learn all about it,

27
00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:22.720
though I will show you the core essentials,

28
00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:26.110
and walk through those together with you in this module.

29
00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:29.050
Just want to point you at those extra resources,

30
00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:31.510
which can also be interesting.

31
00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:33.620
With that, however, let's now dive in

32
00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:37.020
and let's see how we can utilize this syntax

33
00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.270
in our Node projects to switch away from that

34
00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:43.640
require and module exports syntax,

35
00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:45.400
which we use throughout the entire course,

36
00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:49.130
though not without saying one important thing first.

37
00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:51.150
The syntax you'll learn in this course

38
00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:53.230
and this way of importing and exporting

39
00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:56.240
with const, require, module exports,

40
00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:59.930
what we did in this course is the de facto standard

41
00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:01.500
for Node projects.

42
00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.740
Switching to this newer syntax,

43
00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:06.080
which I'm about to show you in this module,

44
00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:08.670
is optional, and you can do it,

45
00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:11.930
but the vast majority of projects, as I mentioned already,

46
00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:13.920
will use that other syntax.

47
00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:17.283
So this is really just an option here, not mandatory.
