00:02.170 --> 00:08.200
So I added a message box in the last lecture, you can download the finished version of the entire project

00:08.230 --> 00:09.010
attached,

00:09.130 --> 00:14.070
I simply added css classes to my div which surrounds the message

00:14.170 --> 00:17.200
and then I worked on these classes in the main css file,

00:17.290 --> 00:25.510
I added user message and user message error and also added some user message entry to my desktop sys

00:25.810 --> 00:29.770
classes. So you can add this manually from the attached code,

00:29.770 --> 00:36.790
now one thing you'll notice is that even if you load the login page regularly, you'll see an empty box

00:36.790 --> 00:37.540
here.

00:37.600 --> 00:44.980
So even if no message is flashed, it looks like error message is not set to undefined and therefore let's

00:44.980 --> 00:52.780
quickly go to auth and let's simply console log request flash error to see what's in there that's

00:52.780 --> 00:55.040
causing this to not be undefined

00:55.050 --> 00:59.690
basically. So if I reload this page, I see it's an empty array

01:01.090 --> 01:05.520
and if I do enter something here, you see

01:05.740 --> 01:10.490
it's an array of messages.

01:10.550 --> 01:17.690
So in the end what do we want to do is we want to extract our message here is equal to request flash

01:18.370 --> 01:28.530
error. Now if message length is now greater than zero, then I know I have a message in there,

01:29.000 --> 01:35.310
so now I'll actually turn this into a variable by using let here and then I can set message equal to message the

01:35.310 --> 01:43.150
first element because I want to retrieve that otherwise I'll set message equal to null and now down there,

01:43.600 --> 01:53.600
we can use the message and pass that as an error message. If we now save that, don't have the box here, if I

01:53.730 --> 01:55.120
do enter something invalid,

01:55.120 --> 01:56.600
we do see the error message though

01:56.710 --> 02:00.400
but if I go to the login page regularly without an error, I don't see it.

02:00.400 --> 02:06.070
So this is now how we can use these flash messages and output them in a nice error box.

02:06.070 --> 02:08.110
Now here's also a challenge for you,

02:08.200 --> 02:11.700
find some other places in the login and sign up screen

02:11.710 --> 02:15.870
where it would make sense to flash other messages onto the screen.

02:15.880 --> 02:17.980
We'll do it together in the next lecture.
