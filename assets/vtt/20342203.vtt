00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:06.270
<v Instructor>Now why do we have and need Deno?</v>

2
00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:08.140
Well, if we need it or not is, of course,

3
00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:10.690
up to you and the entire community to decide.

4
00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:15.690
We have it because Ryan Dahl, the creator of Node,

5
00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:19.680
so the person who invented Node 10 years ago,

6
00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.810
is also the creator of Deno.

7
00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.680
And he came up with Deno, because he simply

8
00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:27.600
wasn't happy with Node anymore.

9
00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.530
Now I wanna be very clear.

10
00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:32.910
Node is not going to go anywhere.

11
00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:34.750
And you don't need to take this from me,

12
00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:37.280
you can take it from Ryan himself.

13
00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:39.050
Node is not going anywhere.

14
00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:42.490
It's mature, it's big, it's there, it's established,

15
00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:45.670
it's being used by thousands of developers and companies.

16
00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:47.980
So Node isn't going anywhere.

17
00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:50.900
But Deno can be worth a look,

18
00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:54.740
because it does some small things differently than Node,

19
00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:57.390
simply because Ryan thought like,

20
00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.850
well there was this chance of making Node better.

21
00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:03.660
And Deno is the result of that, you could say.

22
00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.350
Now, we'll come back to this question

23
00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:08.500
of whether you wanna progress with Deno, Deno,

24
00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:09.680
whatever you wanna call it,

25
00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:13.010
or if you should stick to Node at the end of the module.

26
00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:14.650
I'll come back to that there.

27
00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:15.800
The main takeaway is that

28
00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:17.410
there will be some core differences,

29
00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:19.640
which we'll see in action throughout this module,

30
00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:20.530
but that, of course,

31
00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:23.660
you might not need all those enhancements

32
00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:25.090
introduced by Deno.

33
00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:29.290
So therefore, the established, highly active ecosystem,

34
00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:31.740
the fact that it's production-proved

35
00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.270
and that it's very mature,

36
00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.973
that might be strong reasons for sticking to Node.

37
00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:39.270
Deno, of course, has some core differences,

38
00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:40.890
which also might be interesting,

39
00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.080
and therefore, we'll now have a look at all of that

40
00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:44.240
throughout this module.

41
00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:46.530
We'll get started by installing Deno,

42
00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.440
and by writing some basic code with it,

43
00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:50.320
and we'll then, by the end of the module,

44
00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:53.023
find out whether you should switch or stick.
