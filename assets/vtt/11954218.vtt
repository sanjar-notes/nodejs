So what is a cookie?

00:04.210 --> 00:11.200
Well here's our setup, we got a user using browser and we got our server where our node application runs

00:11.200 --> 00:11.880
on.

00:11.950 --> 00:18.310
Now the user interacts with the frontend with the views we render with the ejs templating engine

00:18.310 --> 00:23.410
in this course but of course I'm talking about any views you might be rendering in your project with

00:23.410 --> 00:28.910
which ever templating engine you are using and from inside that view,

00:28.930 --> 00:32.280
let's say we have a form there to add a new product,

00:32.410 --> 00:35.930
we submit a request to our node server.

00:36.220 --> 00:43.260
Now let's say that request requires us to store some kind of data in the browser,

00:43.270 --> 00:49.720
let's say we're not working with the add product page but let's say we have a login page and when the

00:49.720 --> 00:55.750
user logs in, we want to store the information that the user is logged in somewhere so that when the

00:55.750 --> 01:01.300
user reloads the page and therefore technically a new request is sent, we still have that information

01:01.300 --> 01:03.670
around that the user is logged in

01:03.940 --> 01:10.140
and for that, we can send back a cookie with the response we send back upon the request.

01:10.180 --> 01:17.000
So the user submits the login data and we return a response which can be a new view to which we redirect

01:17.000 --> 01:17.550
to user

01:17.680 --> 01:26.320
but we also include our cookie and that cookie simply is important to well telling the user or to storing

01:26.320 --> 01:32.350
that information that the user is authenticated. We can store that information in the browser,

01:32.380 --> 01:37.990
so in the frontend so to say, in the environment the user interacts with and we can send this

01:38.230 --> 01:44.410
with subsequent requests to include the cookie there to send the data we stored in the cookie, like for

01:44.410 --> 01:48.350
example that information that we are logged in to the server,

01:48.370 --> 01:51.310
so cookies are stored on the client side.

01:51.340 --> 01:53.270
Now this is really abstract,

01:53.350 --> 01:54.430
let's simply try it out

01:54.430 --> 01:55.390
in our application.
