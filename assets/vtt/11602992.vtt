00:02.240 --> 00:08.720
We're now storing a product with all the data we need, now we should also display all that real data

00:08.810 --> 00:11.110
and don't show any dummy data anymore.

00:11.450 --> 00:17.630
So for that, let's go to our product-list.ejs file which is one of the views where we do display

00:17.630 --> 00:23.670
all products and there, we already output the real product title but that's it.

00:23.960 --> 00:28.970
The image source for example is something we should now also replace

00:29.100 --> 00:35.240
and we can simply add our ejs expression in there and output image url and this will be

00:35.240 --> 00:36.720
a string that should be a valid

00:36.730 --> 00:39.410
url, so this should be displayable.

00:39.410 --> 00:43.460
Now for the alternative text, we can also use the title again,

00:43.580 --> 00:48.490
so I simply copied the ejs expression up there, for the price

00:48.500 --> 00:50.660
let's say it's always dollars,

00:50.810 --> 00:59.520
so I'll keep that dollar sign here as hardcoded text and then output product price and for the description

00:59.520 --> 01:00.060
here,

01:00.420 --> 01:09.070
I will of course also replace the dummy text with my description as it is saved in the product.

01:09.180 --> 01:13.330
Now all old products will not fulfill this new structure,

01:13.500 --> 01:21.420
so in the data folder in products.json, I will actually remove them all from that array here so that

01:21.420 --> 01:22.880
it's an empty array again.

01:23.490 --> 01:26.220
With that back in product list, this is looking good,

01:26.220 --> 01:29.010
now in index.ejs, we have the same logic

01:29.010 --> 01:34.850
so we can simply copy that and back in index.ejs simply replace it.

01:34.860 --> 01:42.600
Now if I reload my app on shop and product, we got no products but if I add a new one, this is a test

01:42.600 --> 01:51.300
product or simply a book. Let's search an image, I picked a url here and insert it here,

01:51.560 --> 01:54.290
then let's add a price 19.99

01:54.290 --> 01:57.800
and this is an awesome book,

01:57.800 --> 01:59.610
sounds like a good title.

01:59.630 --> 02:07.920
Now you can press add products and right now this does not support decimal numbers, to fix this,

02:07.960 --> 02:14.420
we can change something in the add product view, there on the number input

02:14.440 --> 02:19.110
we simply have to add a step attribute and set the step to 0.01,

02:19.120 --> 02:25.080
this means you can have well two decimal places essentially and increment in this step size.

02:25.240 --> 02:26.890
I'll save this but not reload,

02:26.890 --> 02:33.070
for now I'll simply go with a number without decimal places to not lose my other data and hit add product

02:33.070 --> 02:39.430
and indeed on the starting page, it's now showing this product with all the data I entered.

02:39.430 --> 02:43.250
So now we improved that and we made a major step forward,

02:43.340 --> 02:46.500
therefore on both these pages obviously we see it,

02:46.780 --> 02:53.220
let's now of course also work on making sure that as an admin, we also see the products here

02:53.380 --> 02:57.800
and we then not just see them but we can also edit or delete them.

02:58.030 --> 02:59.750
That will be the next step.
