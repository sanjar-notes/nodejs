Last but not least let's make sure we can also delete data so that you see that last part of the crud

00:07.380 --> 00:09.670
operations with mongoose as well.

00:09.840 --> 00:17.820
For that, we got our post delete product action and I'm calling delete by ID here on my product model.

00:17.820 --> 00:25.170
Now if I have a look at delete, you'll see this is not something offered by mongoose,

00:25.230 --> 00:31.850
however we do have find by id and remove and that is exactly what we want here right,

00:31.870 --> 00:34.900
so if we call that then we've got everything we need,

00:35.050 --> 00:39.840
this is a built in method provided by mongoose that should remove a document

00:40.150 --> 00:44.660
And now we can go to the admin routes again, comment in that last admin route again,

00:44.770 --> 00:46.260
save that

00:46.300 --> 00:49.180
and with that being saved, if I now click delete,

00:49.600 --> 00:56.470
no products are found and we can of course also confirm this in compass if I refresh, there are no documents

00:56.470 --> 00:58.390
in the products collection.

00:58.390 --> 01:04.630
So this is how we can work with mongoose and do basic crud operations with it.

01:04.630 --> 01:12.370
Now let's again add a user and see how we can relate different entities with mongoose, so how we can

01:12.370 --> 01:13.730
manage relations

01:13.930 --> 01:17.230
and let's then add that cart and orders thing again.
