WEBVTT

00:02.340 --> 00:08.700
Now let's start with uploading files and there, we have a really great use case and that of course

00:08.790 --> 00:16.290
is that when we add a new product, we right now always have to enter a url. That is not a very realistic

00:16.290 --> 00:24.270
set up because in a real world application, your users who are trying to sell things will probably

00:24.270 --> 00:28.790
not have pictures of their products stored somewhere in the web,

00:28.920 --> 00:34.530
so we definitely want to give our users the possibility of uploading images and that is exactly what

00:34.530 --> 00:40.920
I'll work on now. Adding file upload means that we have to do two things,

00:40.950 --> 00:47.430
the first thing is that we need to adjust our form here to show a file picker to our users,

00:47.430 --> 00:53.030
so a tool which they can use to well select a file on their operating system on their computer.

00:53.370 --> 00:59.250
And then the second part is that we need to be able to accept that file in the place where we well handle

00:59.250 --> 01:02.100
it, where we handle the incoming requests.

01:02.100 --> 01:06.770
Now let's start with the form and let's add a file picker there.

01:06.810 --> 01:11.930
So we'll dive into our views and there it's in the admin section, the edit product.ejs

01:11.970 --> 01:15.660
file, there we will have our image

01:15.690 --> 01:19.360
url control, this one and in the end,

01:19.410 --> 01:25.080
this image url should now become a file picker. For that, I'll

01:25.080 --> 01:28.240
copy this old block and comment it out

01:28.350 --> 01:31.900
so that we still have it around in case we need it later

01:32.010 --> 01:34.380
but this will now become a new image uploader.

01:34.380 --> 01:37.170
There I'll just have image as a label.

01:37.380 --> 01:44.730
Now that class here where I try to mark this as invalid, I'll remove that because we'll not have an input

01:44.750 --> 01:52.750
where we would add a red border around, the type here will be changed to file, the name I'll change

01:52.750 --> 01:59.340
that to image and I'll change the ID too, also up here therefore

01:59.410 --> 02:02.050
and now the value with which I'll pre-populate this,

02:02.110 --> 02:08.350
I'll remove that because even if we're editing this, I will always present an empty file picker and

02:08.350 --> 02:11.120
we'll just have to tweak our backend logic later

02:11.140 --> 02:16.960
so that when we're editing this and we're not sending a new file, we simply keep the old one and we overwrite

02:16.960 --> 02:18.680
the old one if we do send a new one

02:18.760 --> 02:22.630
but for now I'll simply set up my file input like this.

02:22.630 --> 02:26.790
Now if I save that and I reload this page,

02:26.800 --> 02:30.770
now we have our file picker here which is a default html element and

02:30.770 --> 02:36.950
if we click it, we can select a file like this boat here, you can pick any file, it should be an image

02:36.950 --> 02:37.820
of course.

02:38.240 --> 02:46.190
So now I have chosen that and now if I would enter the rest and add this product, we would fail because

02:46.250 --> 02:53.440
right now we got no logic in place to handle an incoming file, to store it or to do anything with it

02:53.480 --> 02:56.320
and this is the part we'll have to adjust now.

02:56.420 --> 03:02.450
So in the next lecture, I want to make sure that we can handle incoming files just as well as incoming text

03:02.540 --> 03:04.580
which we previously always accepted.
