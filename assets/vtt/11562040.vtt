00:02.150 --> 00:08.360
Now that we already had a pretty close look at nodejs and worked a lot with it,

00:08.570 --> 00:14.120
let's take one step back and let's see how we can both make development a bit easier, how

00:14.120 --> 00:20.960
we can speed that up a little bit and most importantly, how we can actually debug our nodejs apps

00:21.080 --> 00:28.530
or how we can use various tools to understand better what's going on in our nodejs applications.

00:28.730 --> 00:34.290
Because in this module, you will learn some tips and tricks which will hopefully help you write

00:34.320 --> 00:38.130
nodejs applications in a very efficient manner.
