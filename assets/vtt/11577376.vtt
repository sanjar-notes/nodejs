00:02.140 --> 00:06.930
Now that the core basics about nodejs and expressjs are set,

00:06.940 --> 00:13.450
it's time that we work more on what the user sees because ultimately, we obviously want to build an application

00:13.750 --> 00:17.400
which delivers some value to our users, right? Now

00:17.410 --> 00:25.000
thus far we're always returning static html pages and typically this is not what you do in real applications

00:25.030 --> 00:28.480
because you don't just have static html code

00:28.480 --> 00:34.690
most of the time, instead it is pretty common that you have some data managed on your server,

00:34.780 --> 00:40.480
later we will also do that in a database, that you have some data on your server which you want to

00:40.480 --> 00:45.310
dynamically output in the html code you send back to your users.

00:45.310 --> 00:48.690
An example would be a page with a list of products

00:48.790 --> 00:52.190
where these products of course are coming from your database,

00:52.270 --> 01:00.220
so from your server. Or for example, we already have a very simple form where people can submit a new

01:00.220 --> 01:01.520
product title,

01:01.690 --> 01:05.920
well right now we're not really doing anything with that, in a real application

01:05.920 --> 01:11.380
you would obviously want to store that and then kind of return it in some other page where you have

01:11.380 --> 01:13.990
that list of products I already mentioned.

01:13.990 --> 01:22.030
So in this module, we will have a first look at how we can start managing data on a node express backend, 

01:22.390 --> 01:24.240
for now without a database,

01:24.250 --> 01:30.850
no worries there will be a very extensive module about the databases in this course so you will learn

01:31.060 --> 01:32.780
how to interact with a database too

01:32.800 --> 01:40.060
but for now, let's just manage data like this and let's focus on something else here, on rendering dynamic,

01:40.270 --> 01:44.020
for now dummy content in our views.

01:44.020 --> 01:50.980
So these html pages which we're returning should now become more dynamic and actually contain some content

01:51.160 --> 01:57.280
that is dynamically entered into them on the server, so that if we had additional data on the server,

01:57.460 --> 02:02.740
we would send back a different html page with different content.

02:02.970 --> 02:10.180
And for this, we'll use something called a templating engine and you will learn how such templating engines,

02:10.270 --> 02:12.090
there is more than one alternative

02:12.100 --> 02:15.190
and I will present some alternatives in this module,

02:15.190 --> 02:18.450
you'll learn how they work and how you can use them.

02:18.460 --> 02:20.150
So this is what's in this module

02:20.200 --> 02:27.190
and with that, let's dive right into it and let's have a look at how we could manage that data before

02:27.190 --> 02:28.990
we then have a look at how we could output it.
