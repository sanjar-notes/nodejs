WEBVTT

00:02.160 --> 00:08.730
A lot of exciting things were covered in the last modules. Rest APIs, async await and we'll continue

00:08.730 --> 00:09.540
on that road,

00:09.630 --> 00:16.800
we'll dive into a very exciting technology that you can use in node applications, web sockets. Web sockets

00:16.950 --> 00:24.210
are a nice way, a protocol essentially which allows us to build real time web services.

00:24.210 --> 00:27.290
Now what exactly does that mean and how does that work?

00:27.300 --> 00:29.640
That is what we'll cover in this module.

00:29.640 --> 00:36.060
You'll learn why you would want to use real time web services and what that actually is and we'll see

00:36.060 --> 00:43.590
how we add real time communication to our node app or to any node app of course. We'll use a certain library

00:43.590 --> 00:49.950
for that, socket.io and I will teach you everything you need to know about why to use that, how it works,

00:50.100 --> 00:53.240
what you can do with that and how you use it in your project.
