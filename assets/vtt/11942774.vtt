00:02.120 --> 00:03.970
So let's make add product work again

00:03.980 --> 00:06.980
and for this we'll not use the user anymore

00:07.040 --> 00:10.510
but instead here before we use then, we'll re-use that

00:10.520 --> 00:13.400
so no need to delete it, before we do that

00:13.400 --> 00:20.900
we'll use our product model. So I'll create a new product constant by initialising product again and here,

00:20.930 --> 00:29.360
I will simply pass title, price, description and the image url, so we'll pass all that data into the

00:29.360 --> 00:31.550
constructor of the product.

00:31.790 --> 00:40.340
Then on this product, I can call save and then here to call then, I'll go into my model again and I will

00:40.580 --> 00:42.300
return this here,

00:42.320 --> 00:50.140
so I'll return my collection and then this entire command chain because that will allow me to well treat

00:50.150 --> 00:53.640
this overall as a promise and chain then thereafter

00:53.690 --> 00:55.950
and then therefore also redirect.

00:55.950 --> 01:02.690
So now with that if I save that and I go back to the form and resubmit that, I'm actually redirected

01:02.690 --> 01:06.840
to a page which is not found because I commented out all the shop pages

01:07.040 --> 01:11.390
but if we go back to our server side console, we see something interesting.

01:11.600 --> 01:18.620
We see that this here has to be the output of this console log line in the product model where I print

01:18.620 --> 01:23.820
the result of the insert operation and there, we see a lot of data about that operation

01:23.930 --> 01:29.690
and for us important, if we scroll down to the bottom, we see one document was inserted.

01:29.810 --> 01:35.990
It received an ID and such an ID is managed automatically by mongodb because every document

01:35.990 --> 01:38.510
needs to have such a _id,

01:38.510 --> 01:43.850
this is a must have and mongodb creates it on the fly automatically if the object you entered

01:43.850 --> 01:45.040
does not have it,

01:45.170 --> 01:47.410
so we'll use that auto-generated ID

01:47.840 --> 01:52.770
and then you see the data which we entered also was stored.

01:52.770 --> 01:56.940
So whilst we can't look into database yet because we're not fetching anything,

01:56.960 --> 02:03.830
we see that our insert one operation was successful and did successfully add a product into the collection

02:04.010 --> 02:05.650
which is of course amazing.
