You probably do notice that we do repeat a base structure in all our files here and of course it's

00:09.940 --> 00:12.450
a bit annoying that we manually have to do that,

00:12.460 --> 00:19.510
for example this base setup and also the import of main css as well as the header is part of every

00:19.570 --> 00:27.460
single page and therefore it's a bit cumbersome if we manually have to repeat this setup or this import

00:27.550 --> 00:28.500
all the time,

00:28.510 --> 00:31.180
so what can we do regarding that?

00:31.330 --> 00:38.560
We can create a so-called layout. For this I'll create a new subfolder in views which I'll name layouts

00:38.570 --> 00:42.080
in case we might have multiple ones and I'll add a main layout.pug

00:42.170 --> 00:43.670
file.

00:43.670 --> 00:50.420
Now I'll take my add or my shop.pug file or maybe 404 which is the most minimal one and copy

00:50.420 --> 00:53.810
that file content into main layout.

00:53.810 --> 00:59.810
Now of course we get some elements in here which are dynamic now, which depend on the page I want to use 

00:59.810 --> 01:04.210
and the question is how can we reuse this skeleton anyways.

01:04.280 --> 01:11.930
Well we can extend this layout from inside our other pug views and we can actually define some placeholders,

01:11.960 --> 01:16.620
some hooks in this layout where other views can then enter their content.

01:16.640 --> 01:21.330
For example here in the links, we get a base layout which looks like this

01:21.500 --> 01:24.670
but in other views that should extend this layout,

01:24.740 --> 01:28.820
they might use this layout and add more links in this place.

01:29.120 --> 01:35.090
We can define such a hook by adding the block keyword which pug understands and then defining any name

01:35.090 --> 01:37.730
of our choice, styles for example.

01:37.850 --> 01:42.780
Now we will be able to add more styles from inside other files here

01:42.860 --> 01:46.070
and I will show you how to add this in a second.

01:46.130 --> 01:49.230
I also want to remove that active link here,

01:49.490 --> 01:56.630
by the way also in the 404.pug file because I have no assumption about what's active and I will show you how

01:56.630 --> 01:59.290
to dynamically set this in a second too.

01:59.630 --> 02:02.900
Now the content below the header also is dynamic

02:03.200 --> 02:05.470
and here I again will reserve a block,

02:05.510 --> 02:09.460
so a hook which I'll name content and the name again is up to you.

02:09.800 --> 02:15.650
So now we get this basic layout with two hooks we can dynamically enter content into from inside our

02:15.820 --> 02:17.580
other files.

02:17.600 --> 02:22.300
Now let's start with the 404.pug page here, there

02:22.720 --> 02:30.960
I will just copy that content that matters to me and remove the entire rest and we can now extend the layout

02:30.960 --> 02:38.140
by adding the extends keyword which pug understands and now we just need to point at the layout. For that

02:38.190 --> 02:42.730
we have the layouts folder and we want to use the main layout file in there,

02:43.630 --> 02:45.480
we have to add .pug here too.

02:45.560 --> 02:48.590
So now we're telling pug that we want to extend this

02:48.940 --> 02:55.450
and now we just have to tell it what to render in that content and maybe also in that styles hook we

02:55.450 --> 03:01.510
defined. For styles I don't need any special setting here but for the content block, I want to enter

03:01.510 --> 03:08.890
my own custom content and I do this by again typing block content but now since I extend a layout, this will

03:08.890 --> 03:15.030
not define a hook but actually allow me to add content in that layout and then indent it here,

03:15.130 --> 03:20.320
I define what should be injected into the content block in the layout,

03:20.320 --> 03:28.600
so in this place. With that if I save that and I enter some random path which doesn't exist, I still get

03:28.600 --> 03:36.480
page not found but now behind the scenes, this actually uses my layout and we can of course do the same

03:37.500 --> 03:46.170
on the other pages, like add product. There let's also for now keep the other content so that we can copy and paste

03:46.470 --> 03:49.260
content over into our new layout,

03:49.260 --> 03:52.810
so we extend main layout pointing at the layout file

03:53.040 --> 04:02.160
and here I will add something to the content but also into my styles block and we do that by simply

04:02.190 --> 04:10.170
typing block styles here and then indent it, we add what we want to add and these are these two lines

04:10.200 --> 04:14.980
because these are the two style imports which are not part of the default layout.

04:15.150 --> 04:22.560
So let's add them here in the styles block and then we have the other block, the content block, this one

04:23.130 --> 04:25.990
where I want to enter my own content.

04:26.020 --> 04:33.400
So for that, I will copy the entire part in the main section here or the entire main section actually, like

04:33.400 --> 04:40.880
this, cut it and move it over and replace this h1 tag here and make sure the indentation is correct

04:40.960 --> 04:49.120
and now we can remove the entire rest here and we should now have a file that does extend our layout

04:50.560 --> 04:57.220
and therefore still looks the way it look before but now it uses this way more concise approach which

04:57.220 --> 05:02.510
also ensures that if we ever change something to the layout, we don't have to change it in all the files

05:02.650 --> 05:08.430
but only in that main layout file and the other files since they extend it will automatically get it.

05:08.440 --> 05:13.780
So let's save this, let's go to add product and this looks good. Styling is good

05:13.780 --> 05:21.390
so all these styles are imported as you can see and it looks like before almost. We got this active class

05:21.400 --> 05:25.030
missing, we don't see that the add product link is the active one

05:25.180 --> 05:29.490
and that makes sense because in the main layout, we make no assumption what is active.

05:29.500 --> 05:32.710
So the question is, how can we dynamically set this?
