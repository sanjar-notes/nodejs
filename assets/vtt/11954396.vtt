00:02.140 --> 00:08.110
So that's it for this module. I'll actually dive into some other authentication related things in the next

00:08.290 --> 00:14.470
modules, for example we'll add password resetting but these are the basic things you need to know about

00:14.500 --> 00:21.070
authentication. You learned what authentication means, that it means that not every visitor of your page

00:21.070 --> 00:27.580
can view and do everything, that authentication has to happen on the server side to ensure that users

00:27.610 --> 00:34.180
don't trick you into thinking they are authenticated and that you therefore use sessions to store the

00:34.180 --> 00:40.630
authentication status and that you can protect routes by checking that session controlled login status

00:40.810 --> 00:46.750
right before the request reaches your controller action or the code in general that is executed in a

00:46.750 --> 00:47.580
route.

00:48.100 --> 00:54.310
Now authentication obviously also is strongly tied to security and providing a good user experience

00:54.900 --> 01:01.840
and therefore passwords should absolutely be stored in a hashed form. If you store them in plain text,

01:01.840 --> 01:07.700
if your database gets compromised, the attackers have full access to your user accounts.

01:07.720 --> 01:15.040
Additionally csrf attacks, cross-site request forgery attacks are a real issue because your session

01:15.040 --> 01:21.880
can be stolen there so to say and therefore you should implement csrf protection as shown in this module

01:22.060 --> 01:26.110
in any production ready app you're planning to ship.

01:26.110 --> 01:32.350
Now for a better user experience, you can look into flashing data or messages as we did it in this module

01:32.650 --> 01:34.300
into your session store,

01:34.300 --> 01:40.380
flashing means that this data will be removed from the session automatically by the package we used once

01:40.390 --> 01:48.280
we used the data and we can use that data to persist data across redirects because redirects technically

01:48.580 --> 01:54.420
trigger two different requests or we have the old request we redirect and then a new request starts and

01:54.440 --> 01:59.450
if we want to share data across request as you learned, we need to use a session.

01:59.920 --> 02:02.910
So these are the general authentication related things you need

02:02.980 --> 02:08.010
and with this knowledge, you already get very very far.

02:08.010 --> 02:14.500
Now in the next module, we'll have a look at how we can send mails from inside our node application because

02:14.500 --> 02:20.670
we'll need that feature to then enhance our application a little bit regarding the authentication so that

02:20.680 --> 02:24.880
we can also add a password resetting mechanism.

02:25.000 --> 02:28.060
We'll do this in the module thereafter but in the next module,

02:28.060 --> 02:30.190
let's first of all have a look at how we send mails.
