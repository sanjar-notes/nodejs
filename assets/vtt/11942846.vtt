In this module we had to look at NoSQL and especially mongodb of course. Now NoSQL databases,

00:08.890 --> 00:14.840
mongodb is just an alternative to SQL databases, it follows a different philosophy.

00:14.840 --> 00:20.210
You have no strict schemas which you do have in SQL and you have fewer relations,

00:20.210 --> 00:23.310
you don't split your data across dozens of tables

00:23.330 --> 00:30.230
instead you work with things like embedding data or using some references or even mixing the two concepts

00:30.320 --> 00:32.200
as you saw in this module too,

00:32.210 --> 00:35.320
so in general you've got way more flexibility

00:35.480 --> 00:39.650
and since you can store the data in the format you are fetching it in,

00:39.680 --> 00:47.710
you often can write a bit simpler queries because data already has the format you need it in.

00:48.140 --> 00:49.810
When working with mongodb,

00:49.940 --> 00:54.860
you should use the official mongodb driver and then you got a lot of useful commands like insert

00:54.860 --> 01:02.210
one, find, update one, delete one and so on which make all these crud operations, crud stands for create,

01:02.270 --> 01:03.880
read, update and delete

01:03.890 --> 01:05.110
very simple.

01:05.390 --> 01:12.290
Now check out the official docs or my full mongodb course to learn all about the available operations,

01:12.290 --> 01:17.500
how you can configure them, which operators like $in which you saw in this module,

01:17.510 --> 01:23.720
so all these things which you can use. You can learn about that because indeed mongodb offers enough

01:23.720 --> 01:25.530
content for an entire course

01:25.580 --> 01:31.640
and this is of course not the idea behind this course, it should stay a nodejs course. Now it's also worth

01:31.640 --> 01:38.240
pointing out that all the operations are promise based and therefore creating more complex chains

01:38.270 --> 01:39.310
as we did it

01:39.440 --> 01:45.670
where you have this first command and then the second command is pretty easy and also pretty easy to read.

01:45.710 --> 01:52.310
So overall NoSQL in mongodb is very popular especially in combination with nodejs because

01:52.310 --> 01:57.770
you work with javascript objects anyways and because it's very fast and therefore it's definitely worth

01:57.770 --> 01:58.620
checking out

01:58.730 --> 02:00.290
and I will also stick to

02:00.290 --> 02:02.690
mongodb for the rest of this course, though

02:02.750 --> 02:06.460
I also want to mention that you can of course use MySQL.

02:06.590 --> 02:12.780
Ultimately it always depends on your preferences and the requirements of your application and there

02:12.780 --> 02:16.850
is a large gray area where neither of the two is wrong to use.
