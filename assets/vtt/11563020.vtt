00:02.110 --> 00:03.930
Syntax errors can be very annoying

00:03.940 --> 00:07.190
but most of the time, they're not that hard to fix.

00:07.210 --> 00:13.330
Let's add a simple syntax error, here in app.js let's simply remove the t in const,

00:13.330 --> 00:15.990
now all of a sudden, this is an invalid keyword,

00:16.000 --> 00:18.050
it doesn't exist, it's not a keyword

00:18.130 --> 00:23.270
and we already get some help in the IDE which is showing us something is wrong here.

00:23.560 --> 00:28.010
Now if we hover over this, we see that a semi-colon is expected

00:28.090 --> 00:30.450
and actually this is not that helpful

00:30.620 --> 00:35.020
and this is simply because visual studio code thinks so that this is a variable

00:35.140 --> 00:40.470
and since we have a variable in the same line, we should close this with a semi-colon

00:40.600 --> 00:46.550
and now it actually doesn't show an error. But let's save this and let's try running our app with npm

00:46.690 --> 00:51.160
start without that semi-colon we added. And you will see, it right away

00:51.180 --> 00:57.110
crashes and in there we see unexpected identifier const server.

00:57.160 --> 01:03.040
So in the end, whilst it doesn't clearly tell us that we forgot the t here because it's not smart enough

01:03.040 --> 01:05.120
to understand that this is the error here,

01:05.200 --> 01:08.930
we still see that the error seems to be stemming from this line

01:09.190 --> 01:14.890
and in such cases, as dumb as it sounds, you should simply take a closer look at this line and see what

01:14.890 --> 01:15.980
could be wrong there

01:16.180 --> 01:18.270
and you should quickly be able to see

01:18.430 --> 01:19.780
I forgot a t here.

01:20.170 --> 01:21.730
So these are syntax errors,

01:22.030 --> 01:29.400
other errors would be that you maybe go to the routes.js file and let's say you forget a closing curly

01:29.400 --> 01:30.390
brace here.

01:30.390 --> 01:34.680
Now again visual studio code does complain and does show an error over there, 

01:34.920 --> 01:39.590
if we jump there we see at the end that the closing curly brace is expected.

01:39.600 --> 01:44.130
Now it's not expected at this point where it's showing this message but it's expected somewhere in the

01:44.130 --> 01:46.670
file and whilst it can be cumbersome,

01:46.680 --> 01:52.170
you should then check your block statements like this if statement and see if there are all closed correctly.

01:52.710 --> 01:57.870
In visual studio code, you also get some help because if you click next to such a curly brace, you'll see

01:57.870 --> 02:03.860
that this line gets highlighted and it actually shows you where it thinks that this is getting closed

02:03.930 --> 02:06.570
and this is far too much at the bottom here

02:06.570 --> 02:14.610
for example. Again if you run this, you will see that it crashes and there, you also see unexpected token

02:15.090 --> 02:16.750
and it points us at routes.js

02:16.780 --> 02:17.170
.

02:17.220 --> 02:19.650
and then you see the line number too.

02:19.920 --> 02:26.370
So here it points us at line 52 and it basically shows us the same place as visual studio code which

02:26.370 --> 02:27.600
is the wrong place

02:27.780 --> 02:33.870
but in such a case here, you should really take the IDE help, see that error message and then go through

02:33.870 --> 02:35.430
your file and see

02:35.440 --> 02:41.850
hmm where could I be missing a character or where do I have an extra closing curly brace or something

02:41.850 --> 02:42.540
like that

02:42.690 --> 02:47.090
and eventually you should be able to find this error and therefore of course fix it.

02:47.370 --> 02:53.820
So syntax errors should always result in an error message and then that can sometimes be hard to find

02:53.820 --> 02:54.490
them,

02:54.560 --> 03:02.880
often it's like a typo, a mistyped variable name of a variable that therefore doesn't exist or missing

03:02.880 --> 03:08.190
or extra characters but you can find them and it just takes some time to go through your file.
