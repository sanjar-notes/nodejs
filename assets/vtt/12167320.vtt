00:02.400 --> 00:08.040
So in this module, we had a closer look at socket.io and I hope it became clear what you can do with it.

00:08.070 --> 00:15.420
You can push information from the server to the client through that emit method provided by socket.io

00:15.660 --> 00:21.480
and I also mentioned that socket.io is not the only way of implementing web sockets because behind the

00:21.480 --> 00:27.240
scenes, it's that web sockets protocol that allows you to push data from the server to a connected client.

00:27.810 --> 00:35.310
Socket.io just makes using that web socket protocol, that technology particularly easy and therefore

00:35.310 --> 00:42.600
it's a very popular package. Definitely dive into the official docs of socket.io to learn all about

00:42.600 --> 00:48.720
the different features it offers and what you can do with it because it's a very powerful library, it

00:48.710 --> 00:50.520
gives you a lot of cool features,

00:50.580 --> 00:54.460
so definitely check out the official docs to learn more about it

00:54.630 --> 00:59.970
and of course also have a look at the other implementations you might be able to use.

01:00.360 --> 01:07.230
I just want you to be aware that web sockets are something that build up on http, you establish them

01:07.320 --> 01:11.730
as you'd see in our application, as a http handshake,

01:11.730 --> 01:19.350
so you need a running http server either set up with just nodejs or a package like express and you can

01:19.350 --> 01:25.000
use that server to establish a socket, a web socket connection on top of that.

01:25.230 --> 01:27.620
So both run simultaneously

01:27.690 --> 01:33.370
and as you see in our example app, we actually got both going on. We got normal requests

01:33.390 --> 01:37.410
so to say and we take advantage of socket.io as well.

01:37.620 --> 01:43.010
So this is an exciting piece of technology that might be interesting for your next application too

01:43.170 --> 01:46.420
and I hope that this module provided a nice introduction to it.
