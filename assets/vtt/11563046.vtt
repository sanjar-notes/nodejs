There's one more feature about the nodejs debugger which I also haven't shown you yet but which I of course

00:07.820 --> 00:12.320
don't want to forget. If you start debugging here

00:12.530 --> 00:18.830
and here I just use the shortcut and you place a breakpoint anywhere in your app and then do something

00:18.830 --> 00:20.580
to trigger that breakpoint,

00:20.690 --> 00:24.710
I showed you that you can look into all these variables and that you can look into them in the debug

00:24.710 --> 00:30.620
console without changing them. Well sometimes you might want to change them

00:30.890 --> 00:38.560
and that can be done by going to the debug view here and then by simply typing in there.

00:38.570 --> 00:44.280
Now for example, the parsed body holds this string and you can't just change it

00:44.330 --> 00:49.330
and now this will affect the runtime as you can see if you hover over this.

00:49.340 --> 00:55.040
So now if I just resume execution with my code which doesn't have a bug right now and I go back to

00:55.040 --> 01:01.550
my explorer view here, then you will see that I stored testing here which is the value I edited

01:01.610 --> 01:08.840
in the debugger. So you can actually manipulate the values there of the variables and so on if you need

01:08.840 --> 01:09.540
to,

01:09.800 --> 01:15.620
you can do that because this of course allows you to make sure that you can quickly test something.

01:15.710 --> 01:20.730
This is just another useful feature which I wanted to share with you since it can help you with debugging

01:20.730 --> 01:23.700
your code, being able to manipulate some values there.
