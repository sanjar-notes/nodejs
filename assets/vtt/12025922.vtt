I'm really happy with the shape our course application is taking and we're diving into many exciting

00:07.690 --> 00:08.230
features

00:08.230 --> 00:14.740
we can build with node and express as you see. Now that we're able to work with files and even generate

00:14.740 --> 00:17.130
them on the fly on the server,

00:17.290 --> 00:24.830
let's dive back into some work with our database or interactions with our database. There right now

00:24.850 --> 00:31.900
we always fetch all products when we display the product page. In this module, we'll dive into a technique

00:31.930 --> 00:38.590
called pagination which allows us to split our data across multiple pages, something you typically want

00:38.590 --> 00:41.370
to do when you work with a lot of data.

00:41.380 --> 00:46.530
So let me show you how this can be implemented with our application in this module.
