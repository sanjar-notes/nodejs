00:02.130 --> 00:05.300
So now that you learned what's inside this course a whole lot

00:05.300 --> 00:11.070
as you can see, let me explain to you how you can get the most out of this course because this is really

00:11.070 --> 00:12.020
important to me,

00:12.030 --> 00:14.340
I want to make sure that you learned a lot.

00:14.340 --> 00:17.360
Now obviously you want to watch the videos,

00:17.460 --> 00:21.400
now that seems pretty obvious but this is a video on-demand course.

00:21.470 --> 00:23.820
Watch the videos at your speed,

00:23.820 --> 00:24.920
this is really important.

00:25.020 --> 00:29.810
You can use the playback controls here on Udemy to finetune the speed, speed me up if I'm going

00:29.810 --> 00:33.390
too slow, reduce the speed a bit if I'm going too fast,

00:33.390 --> 00:39.290
also make sure to occasionally jump back to older sections or videos.

00:39.300 --> 00:41.220
This is a normal process in learning,

00:41.220 --> 00:47.580
sometimes you need to reiterate concepts you learned before, you want to use that on-demand nature

00:47.580 --> 00:48.360
of the course.

00:48.360 --> 00:55.510
You don't have to go at the speed I'm going, you don't have to go lecture by lecture and then never go back,

00:55.560 --> 01:02.430
use the tools you got here, use the course to its fullest potential and use the on-demand nature. In

01:02.430 --> 01:03.300
this course,

01:03.390 --> 01:08.420
we will also build projects and you will find a lot of exercises and assignments.

01:08.700 --> 01:15.060
I encourage you to do these, of course you can also just watch me code and just watch my solutions to

01:15.060 --> 01:15.870
the assignments

01:15.930 --> 01:20.030
but you will learn way more if you try to solve these things on your own

01:20.070 --> 01:22.600
and if you actively code along. Now

01:22.620 --> 01:29.920
one important note for this is of course that you want to do that also at your speed and by

01:30.000 --> 01:37.020
well of course also following along the videos but also make sure to Google for problems if you hit

01:37.050 --> 01:37.610
any,

01:37.770 --> 01:43.770
not because I don't want to help you, I will help you if you need help but because this makes you a better

01:43.800 --> 01:47.060
learner. You need to be able to solve your problems on your own

01:47.070 --> 01:55.380
and I see too many students who have to ask first, research later mentality and this is not really that

01:55.380 --> 01:57.090
great for you,

01:57.090 --> 02:01.080
this makes me learn it better because I get challenged a lot which is great

02:01.200 --> 02:03.050
but you should learn more ultimately.

02:03.060 --> 02:06.230
So definitely try to solve your problems on your own,

02:06.240 --> 02:09.330
it will help you a lot.

02:09.330 --> 02:12.480
Also use all the course resources you find in there,

02:12.480 --> 02:13.980
that's not just the videos,

02:14.010 --> 02:19.770
that's also the attached source code which you find attached to the last lecture of each module which

02:19.770 --> 02:23.320
you can use to compare to your code if you're facing any problems

02:23.340 --> 02:28.740
and again this is a great way of solving problems on your own by comparing the solutions and finding

02:28.740 --> 02:30.750
out what went wrong on your own.

02:30.750 --> 02:33.240
So use all these resources,

02:33.240 --> 02:39.720
also make sure to use the additional links I occasionally post in some lectures where you can research

02:39.720 --> 02:45.330
a bit more about certain topics and dive a bit deeper in cases where you're interested in that topic.

02:46.300 --> 02:51.760
Now last but not least, this course like all Udemy courses has a Q & A section,

02:51.760 --> 02:54.580
you can post questions, on every video

02:54.580 --> 02:59.770
there is a Q & A button at the bottom of the video or in the course dashboard, the general Q & A section

03:00.070 --> 03:01.360
and you can search there,

03:01.390 --> 03:07.210
make sure to also search to Q & A before you post, often a question has already been answered

03:07.390 --> 03:10.850
but you can also post there if you got a question.

03:10.960 --> 03:16.130
Now the thing about asking is asking is easy, answering is hard,

03:16.150 --> 03:17.500
so try helping

03:17.560 --> 03:24.610
others too. Take this opportunity of answering to questions of other students, simply because you again

03:24.760 --> 03:26.050
get challenged

03:26.260 --> 03:32.020
and if you're wrong, that doesn't matter, you'll be corrected and you'll learn again but you will learn

03:32.020 --> 03:35.420
so much by being forced to think about a problem,

03:35.440 --> 03:38.040
articulate a solution and best of all,

03:38.080 --> 03:41.100
you also help students. So help each other,

03:41.230 --> 03:47.500
I will also help you of course but if you do all these things, you'll get a lot out of this course, promised.

03:47.500 --> 03:51.960
But with that, let's leave this first module and continue with the course.
