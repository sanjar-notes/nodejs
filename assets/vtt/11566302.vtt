There is one other notable feature about the express router that I want to show you,

00:07.950 --> 00:12.540
now we have a catch all route and we got our outsourced routes here.

00:12.720 --> 00:18.230
Now sometimes these outsourced routes have a common starting path,

00:18.270 --> 00:26.070
so let's say all the admin routes actually are triggered with admin/add-product and admin, maybe

00:26.070 --> 00:27.570
also add product,

00:27.570 --> 00:33.180
we can repeat the path here because we got different methods, get and post, so these will be two different

00:33.180 --> 00:34.260
routes too.

00:34.280 --> 00:41.220
So that is one important take away already, the same path can be used if the methods differ. Of course

00:41.220 --> 00:42.480
here in the form,

00:42.480 --> 00:48.400
I should also point at add product then but there is another important take away.

00:48.690 --> 00:57.660
If we have such a setup where our paths in such a router file start with the same part or with the

00:57.660 --> 01:05.850
same segment here, we can take that segment out of this route here and then go to the app.js file

01:06.000 --> 01:10.680
and add it here, so add that segment as a filter.

01:10.890 --> 01:17.930
Now only routes starting with /admin will go into the admin routes file

01:17.940 --> 01:26.990
so to say and not only that, it also will or expressjs will also omit or ignore

01:27.130 --> 01:29.610
this /admin part in the

01:29.630 --> 01:33.360
url when it tries to match these routes,

01:33.420 --> 01:41.580
so now /add-product will match the /admin/add-product route because /admin was already

01:41.580 --> 01:42.200
stripped out

01:42.200 --> 01:49.500
here you could say, let me show this to you in practice. If I reload my add product route, we get page not

01:49.500 --> 01:51.600
found because this does not exist anymore,

01:51.750 --> 01:57.630
this is now /admin/add-product and indeed, here is the form

01:57.770 --> 02:03.590
and if I now add my book again here and hit add product, I get page not found

02:03.810 --> 02:10.410
and the reason for that is that of course here in form action, I'm leading to /add-product

02:10.740 --> 02:16.380
but this should be /admin/add-product too because we want to reach that route which is the admin.js

02:16.380 --> 02:22.530
file which is only reachable through requests that have /admin at the beginning.

02:22.530 --> 02:24.300
So let's give this another try,

02:24.480 --> 02:31.510
let's go to /admin/add-product and let's try adding that book again,

02:31.560 --> 02:37.620
now we are redirected and now we can also see that we are logging this here.

02:37.620 --> 02:46.570
So this filtering mechanism here in app.js allows us to put a common starting segment for our

02:46.590 --> 02:53.550
path which all routes in a given file use to outsource that into this app.js file so that we don't

02:53.550 --> 02:56.640
have to repeat it for all the routes here.

02:56.640 --> 03:05.330
Implicitly, this route is reached under admin add product and so is this route here,

03:05.670 --> 03:10.050
this one with a post request and this one with a get request.

03:10.240 --> 03:15.600
Now this can be a bit challenging to wrap your head around but this is another core thing you have

03:15.600 --> 03:21.720
to understand, how these requests are funneled through and how they may reach this file

03:21.810 --> 03:28.650
if they start with /admin because we are filtering here and how in that file, the /admin part

03:28.710 --> 03:35.470
is then not checked again but it only checks the second part and therefore reaches this or these requests

03:35.490 --> 03:36.030
route here.
