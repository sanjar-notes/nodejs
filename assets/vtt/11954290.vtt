We're now using sessions everywhere and we have our dummy authentication process in place, it's missing

00:08.370 --> 00:13.510
crucial features like log out and so on and that will all come in the authentication module

00:13.620 --> 00:17.160
but we have something in place and you might have noticed that of course

00:17.160 --> 00:21.090
regarding the log out, I always just deleted the session cookie.

00:21.090 --> 00:25.770
That is what I did in the assignment too, I deleted the session cookie to demonstrate what happens if

00:25.770 --> 00:30.170
we then try to do something that is relying on data that is stored in the session,

00:30.330 --> 00:36.130
it will fail because the session cookie which is required to identify the correct session is not there.

00:36.330 --> 00:41.490
Now deleting just the cookie is of course not ideal because right now for example if we have a look at

00:41.490 --> 00:47.990
compass and into our sessions collection, I have three sessions here because I always just deleted the cookie.

00:48.030 --> 00:56.220
Now there is a cleaner way of doing that and that cleaner way is to use a method provided by the session

00:56.220 --> 00:57.030
middleware,

00:57.030 --> 00:59.670
now let me show this to you and for that, I'll

00:59.760 --> 01:07.890
first of all go to my views and there to the navigation and next to my login button here,

01:07.890 --> 01:15.600
I'll actually add another field, another list item into which I'll add a form which should lead to log

01:15.600 --> 01:18.050
out and use a post method 

01:18.360 --> 01:28.320
and in that form, I'll have a button like this which is of type submit where I'll say log out.

01:28.430 --> 01:35.000
Now if we save that and we reload our page, we see log out next to login,

01:35.030 --> 01:41.150
now to make sure the styling is correct, we need to add that list item class here which we also have

01:41.150 --> 01:42.920
on the list item here

01:42.920 --> 01:46.870
and after adding this, if we reload this looks better

01:46.880 --> 01:52.560
and now I've got my log out button here. Now when I click this, I want to clear any session I might have 

01:52.790 --> 01:55.670
and for that I of course need to register a new route.

01:55.670 --> 02:02.240
So let's head over to our auth routes and let's add a new post route here because we will send a post

02:02.240 --> 02:08.590
request which goes to log out and there, I will trigger a post log out action in my controller.

02:08.600 --> 02:10.520
Now this action of course does not exist yet

02:10.520 --> 02:17.060
so let's head over to the auth controller and maybe duplicate the post login route here, name it

02:17.060 --> 02:20.800
post log out and in there,

02:21.290 --> 02:24.440
what I want to do is I want to clear my session.

02:24.680 --> 02:30.500
We can do this by reaching out to our session object and then we can call destroy there,

02:30.530 --> 02:34.510
this is a method provided by the session package we're using.

02:34.550 --> 02:40.790
Now this also takes a function which we pass to it which will be called once it's done destroying

02:40.790 --> 02:46.580
the session and in there, request session will then not be available anymore because we got rid of that

02:46.580 --> 02:47.450
session.

02:47.450 --> 02:49.500
We can recreate it for the next request

02:49.580 --> 02:52.520
when we do this again, then it will be set again

02:52.520 --> 02:57.090
but in here, all the session data will be lost because the session was destroyed.

02:57.500 --> 03:04.520
So here I will then actually redirect back to my starting page with res redirect slash,

03:04.520 --> 03:11.000
we also get a potential error here which we can try to log to the console.

03:11.000 --> 03:14.030
Now with that we have the post log out button registered.

03:14.030 --> 03:18.740
Now let's head back to our application and first of all, let's login.

03:18.740 --> 03:20.600
Now let me open the developer tools again,

03:20.690 --> 03:22.360
I've got no session cookie here,

03:22.400 --> 03:30.390
I can click login and redirected session cookie is set and we can now use that session.

03:30.400 --> 03:36.310
Now if we go to compass real quick and we refresh, we see we have four objects now which makes sense,

03:36.310 --> 03:37.510
we had three before,

03:37.540 --> 03:39.690
now we have four

03:39.770 --> 03:41.620
and now let me click log out.

03:41.660 --> 03:46.090
We are redirected, the session cookie here actually still exists

03:47.150 --> 03:54.050
but you see the session was deleted over there and the session cookie still exists but that is no problem

03:54.320 --> 03:56.570
because no matching session will be found

03:56.570 --> 03:59.920
so that is fine, it's basically not doing anything

04:00.050 --> 04:02.490
and it will be renewed once we login again,

04:02.510 --> 04:04.070
then this will be overwritten

04:04.070 --> 04:09.040
and when we close the browser, it would also be deleted because it's not a permanent cookie,

04:09.110 --> 04:14.540
it's a session cookie which means it's a cookie that does not have an expiry date in the future,

04:14.540 --> 04:16.300
it does not have a max age,

04:16.310 --> 04:21.380
it will simply get deleted when we close the browser and it's worthless in this state here.

04:21.380 --> 04:26.780
So now as you see if I click around, I have a problem with my orders here,

04:26.780 --> 04:28.080
I'll fix that in a second

04:28.130 --> 04:30.140
but you see the cookies there,

04:30.170 --> 04:32.230
most importantly the session was cleaned up

04:32.270 --> 04:32.990
back there though.
