Before we start working on the project, let me quickly have a look at rest APIs and the other knowledge

00:11.230 --> 00:17.410
you gained throughout the course, is that now all redundant? We learned about things like setting up our node

00:17.410 --> 00:25.480
and express app, routing, handling requests responses, request validation, database communication, file handling

00:25.510 --> 00:29.410
uploads downloads, sessions and cookies and authentication,

00:29.410 --> 00:32.790
these are some big topics we covered throughout the course.

00:32.920 --> 00:37.300
Now how do we have to adjust our knowledge

00:37.360 --> 00:43.480
now that we build a restful API instead of a view based application?

00:43.840 --> 00:49.330
Well regarding the general setup, we already saw that in the last module there are no changes we need

00:49.330 --> 00:49.870
to do,

00:49.900 --> 00:54.370
we still set up a normal node and express server. Regarding the routing,

00:54.370 --> 00:56.490
we also have no significant changes,

00:56.530 --> 01:00.610
we just use more http methods, more http verbs now,

01:00.700 --> 01:05.320
that's the only difference in the end. For handling requests and responses,

01:05.410 --> 01:06.700
you already learned that

01:06.700 --> 01:10.820
now we work with json data instead of views,

01:10.870 --> 01:14.920
so that is a difference. We render no views anymore,

01:14.950 --> 01:21.150
we have no views folder anymore, we don't use ejs handlebars or anything like that,

01:21.160 --> 01:24.310
instead we only exchange data. So that is a change

01:24.340 --> 01:29.300
but as you learned in the last module, this is also not too hard to implement.

01:29.590 --> 01:35.970
Now if we want to add validation for incoming request data, then we will not have to change anything.

01:36.010 --> 01:42.640
We still can add validation for example with express validator which we used in the validation module

01:42.640 --> 01:48.890
of this course and the way we use it and the logic behind it does not change a single bit.

01:49.330 --> 01:50.750
Database communication,

01:50.770 --> 01:57.120
so working with database, be that a SQL or NoSQL database also does not change,

01:57.160 --> 02:04.420
this happens on the server side in a controller action typically and the logic we write there, the code

02:04.450 --> 02:11.290
we write there is not affected by the data we exchange or by the fact whether we render a view or if

02:11.290 --> 02:17.310
we send around json data. When we talk about file uploads downloads and so on,

02:17.320 --> 02:19.110
there's also not much that changes.

02:19.360 --> 02:22.940
On the server side nothing changes actually, on the client side

02:22.960 --> 02:29.320
the logic changes a little bit and I will show you how we can implement file upload and of course also

02:29.320 --> 02:32.160
serving files in this module.

02:32.290 --> 02:40.900
Now for sessions and cookies, there we have changes because we will not use sessions and cookies anymore

02:41.110 --> 02:41.980
with rest

02:41.980 --> 02:48.790
API and the reason for that simply is that you learned about these restful principles or these rest API

02:48.790 --> 02:55.200
principles and one of them was that each request is treated separately,

02:55.300 --> 03:02.610
it is looked at independently from previous requests, so we have no connection between the client and

03:02.710 --> 03:03.230
server,

03:03.280 --> 03:09.790
we have no shared connection history to be precise and therefore, we manage no sessions on the server

03:09.970 --> 03:17.340
because the rest API does not care about the clients or whether that client connected to the API before

03:17.860 --> 03:20.730
and therefore authentication will also have to change.

03:20.770 --> 03:26.110
We'll use a different authentication approach and I'll show you which approach this is and how to

03:26.110 --> 03:28.730
implement it in this module too.

03:29.110 --> 03:32.320
So overall, there are not too many changes.

03:32.320 --> 03:33.310
Some changes,

03:33.340 --> 03:38.710
he biggest changes are related to sessions and therefore authentication and I will show you how

03:38.710 --> 03:44.500
to implement them but the rest will still work the same you learned it and therefore all the knowledge you

03:44.500 --> 03:48.290
gained throughout the course is of course everything but redundant,

03:48.370 --> 03:50.950
it's still super important.

03:50.950 --> 03:53.070
And with that let's dive in,

03:53.110 --> 03:57.710
let's see which project we'll be working on and how we can work on it.
