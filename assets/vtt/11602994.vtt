00:02.210 --> 00:07.920
So let's work on the admin side then. We get a products.ejs file and in the end I want to render

00:07.920 --> 00:09.360
my products there.

00:09.420 --> 00:16.380
So what we can do is we can copy the product-list.ejs file content and in products.ejs in the

00:16.470 --> 00:18.520
admin area, we can copy that in,

00:18.840 --> 00:24.240
if I now reload this page, we see the same as we see on shop and products but obviously I want to show

00:24.240 --> 00:28.550
different buttons there let's say, so that we can edit or delete them there

00:28.650 --> 00:31.850
and of course we could even change the whole way we display the products

00:31.860 --> 00:36.650
but for now let's focus on the logic and less on how we display that.

00:36.660 --> 00:40.500
So here I have my add to cart button,

00:40.530 --> 00:48.160
now time to change this maybe to an edit button and let's add a second button where I say delete. With that

00:49.560 --> 00:55.200
if we reload, these two buttons are now there and obviously, they don't do anything if I click them, just

00:55.210 --> 00:57.360
as the add to cart button doesn't do anything

00:57.360 --> 00:58.650
by the way.

00:58.650 --> 01:04.380
So as a next step, I want to make sure I can load this to edit it and now to do that,

01:04.410 --> 01:11.390
I first of all need to make sure that clicking this button does send a request and actually I want to send

01:11.390 --> 01:14.880
a simple get request and get onto another page.

01:15.050 --> 01:21.810
We could change this to a link with a reference to another page like this,

01:21.950 --> 01:25.920
if we do that, doesn't look too bad,

01:26.110 --> 01:30.560
styling changed a bit because well some things would have to be adjusted

01:30.730 --> 01:33.060
and I will do that later.

01:33.070 --> 01:43.160
Now we got that link which should of course now lead us to /admin/edit-product, like this. If

01:43.160 --> 01:48.170
I do that we get to the Page Not Found page because we haven't registered a route yet

01:48.350 --> 01:54.650
and the reason for this is that we don't just need to go to /edit-product but obviously we want

01:54.650 --> 01:57.370
to go to a very different route here,

01:57.410 --> 02:02.640
we want to make sure that we go to a route where we know which product to edit.

02:02.810 --> 02:06.990
So actually we'll need to pass something dynamic as part of that

02:07.010 --> 02:12.470
url, it would be great if we could pass something like edit product for the ID 1 and then we can

02:12.470 --> 02:19.730
retrieve that ID in the route that we're loading so that we know which product we need to fetch from

02:19.730 --> 02:22.940
the database or from our file for now.

02:22.940 --> 02:27.410
Now this is some logic we'll add in the next module though because some people might have skipped this

02:27.410 --> 02:32.330
module, so let's ignore this for now and let's focus on deleting

02:32.540 --> 02:37.940
but to be honest we'll face the same problem there because we want to delete a specific product and

02:37.940 --> 02:40.700
not all products obviously.

02:40.700 --> 02:48.290
So therefore here, we can also add a link but technically a delete process should not send a get request

02:48.290 --> 02:49.680
to some route, instead

02:49.810 --> 02:58.340
here I will simply wrap this in a form which leads to admin delete product and sends a post requests

02:58.340 --> 03:03.940
there to indicate that we really want to change something and not just load something or display something

03:04.270 --> 03:11.040
and then I wrap my button in there and give it the type submit so that it does submit this.

03:11.110 --> 03:18.030
So now we get that connected and therefore on admin products, you see that changed due to the form I

03:18.030 --> 03:24.660
added, we'll work on the styling or I will work on the styling between modules, both styles or both routes

03:24.660 --> 03:29.840
will not work because we haven't implemented them but we'll do that later.

03:30.000 --> 03:35.930
The same problem can be found for our Add to Cart here by the way, there

03:35.970 --> 03:40.520
I also want to do something which needs extra information,

03:40.560 --> 03:45.690
I need to have the ID of the product I want to add and I want to add it to the route we're loading

03:45.720 --> 03:47.610
or to the path we're loading.

03:47.640 --> 03:53.220
So here I also want to have a form which goes to something like add to cart,

03:53.220 --> 04:00.660
we don't have that route yet and then adds a method, post and then here I will have a button inside of

04:00.660 --> 04:07.020
that form and obviously I don't just want to go to Add to Cart but I would want something like add to

04:07.020 --> 04:12.120
cart one so that I know which product with which ID to add to a cart.

04:12.390 --> 04:16.340
But again this is something I will do in the next module

04:16.350 --> 04:18.690
just as for the admin routes.

04:19.110 --> 04:21.670
So for now, we're pretty much done,

04:21.690 --> 04:25.770
we added more views, we restructured our controller a little bit,

04:25.830 --> 04:28.420
we practiced what we did thus far

04:28.650 --> 04:35.280
but now of course the exciting thing will be when we finally start working more with dynamic data in

04:35.280 --> 04:42.540
our route paths and when we therefore can start adding items to the cart and editing and deleting items.

04:42.770 --> 04:45.490
We'll do that over the next modules of course.
