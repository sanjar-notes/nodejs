00:02.290 --> 00:07.590
So time to add some database logic and I will again use mongodb and mongoose

00:07.630 --> 00:13.510
and I will use that same mongodb atlas server we configured earlier in the course.

00:13.510 --> 00:18.450
So go back to that mongodb module if you want to see how that worked

00:18.520 --> 00:22.900
and if you want to use MySQL or something like this, you can of course also take the knowledge you

00:22.900 --> 00:29.220
gain in the MySQL related modules of the course and implement your own SQL solution here, to follow

00:29.220 --> 00:30.250
along smoothly

00:30.250 --> 00:32.520
you should use mongodb though.

00:32.530 --> 00:34.540
I will again use the mongoose package,

00:34.630 --> 00:41.590
so let's install it with npm install --save mongoose and that will be required to connect to

00:41.590 --> 00:48.370
the database and to then of course also create our mongoose models, store data and so on.

00:49.090 --> 00:51.940
I'll restart npm start thereafter and now

00:51.940 --> 00:59.710
first of all let's connect. For this let's open the app.js file and let's import mongoose here by simply

00:59.710 --> 01:01.530
requiring mongoose.

01:01.750 --> 01:07.300
Now as you learned in the mongodb and the mongoose modules of this course, we then esstablish a connection

01:07.870 --> 01:14.870
by using mongoose connect here and now we need a url, a connection url.

01:14.990 --> 01:17.320
Now as I mentioned, I'll use that same connection

01:17.320 --> 01:19.940
url I used before in the course

01:20.020 --> 01:21.630
so that does not change,

01:21.670 --> 01:23.930
I will just copy that,

01:23.950 --> 01:24.610
here it is,

01:24.610 --> 01:31.990
that is my atlas server to which I can connect and this now establishes a connection and then I can add

01:32.050 --> 01:36.980
then and a catch block, catch in case this connection establishing fails,

01:37.030 --> 01:38.670
then I want to log the error

01:38.830 --> 01:45.430
but if we are successful, if we are in the then block here, then I will start my node server and start

01:45.430 --> 01:46.960
listening to requests.

01:46.960 --> 01:50.460
If we save that, it now gets restarted and it should succeed,

01:50.530 --> 01:53.170
you can ignore this deprecation warning here by the way.

01:53.350 --> 01:58.810
Now we're connected to mongoose or to mongodb through mongoose and now what can we do?

01:59.080 --> 02:03.970
Well we have to create some models to work with right because that is how we interact with the database

02:04.000 --> 02:05.030
ultimately.

02:05.110 --> 02:11.680
So let's create a models folder here in our node rest API and I'll create a post.js file in there to

02:11.680 --> 02:14.630
define how a post should look like.

02:15.090 --> 02:23.240
There I will simply import mongoose by requiring mongoose from the mongoose package,

02:23.570 --> 02:30.320
we can then extract the schema from that mongoose object, that schema constructor and use that to create

02:30.350 --> 02:31.850
a new post schema,

02:31.850 --> 02:37.670
you can name that however you want but you use new schema to now define how a post should look like

02:37.670 --> 02:40.370
in your database and in your application.

02:40.460 --> 02:43.670
Now you can of course define this in whichever way you want,

02:43.670 --> 02:50.270
I want to have a title in there which will be of type string and you learned all about that schema declaration

02:50.270 --> 02:54.440
thing in the mongoose module, so I'll be walking through that a bit faster.

02:54.770 --> 02:59.250
So type will be string and let's say it's required

02:59.280 --> 03:03.050
and we then also will have an image url

03:03.060 --> 03:06.870
or image or however you want to name it and that will also be a string,

03:06.870 --> 03:13.200
it will be a url pointing at that file and this will also be required.

03:14.520 --> 03:17.340
Now we'll also have a content of course

03:17.960 --> 03:25.850
where the type is string as well and which also is required, so thus far not too exciting.

03:25.850 --> 03:31.720
Now I also will have a creator here and that will later be a link to a user,

03:31.730 --> 03:33.320
for now I don't have that

03:33.470 --> 03:36.460
so for now it will just be an object and be required

03:36.890 --> 03:40.430
but this is only temporary, we'll change this later.

03:40.430 --> 03:42.410
So this is my current set up.

03:42.590 --> 03:48.410
Now I will pass an option to the schema constructor which we haven't seen before, we can configure this

03:48.710 --> 03:53.780
and in that object I'm passing as a second argument to the schema constructor,

03:53.780 --> 03:59.930
I can add the timestamps key and set this to true and mongoose will then automatically add timestamps

03:59.930 --> 04:05.330
when a new version is added to the database, when a new object is added to the database.

04:05.480 --> 04:10.820
So we automatically get a createdAt and updatedAt timestamp out of the box then

04:10.910 --> 04:15.440
and you can learn more about that feature in the official mongoose docs of course.

04:15.440 --> 04:18.970
Last but not least, we now need to export this

04:19.160 --> 04:23.810
and you learned that we don't export the schema but a model based on the schema.

04:24.110 --> 04:29.330
So I use mongoose and then the model method to create a model based on a schema,

04:29.510 --> 04:31.370
you can name that model however you want,

04:31.400 --> 04:38.210
I'll name it post and therefore this will create a post database and I will export my post schema

04:38.210 --> 04:40.180
here or use my post schema,

04:40.370 --> 04:42.890
so this is the model defined.

04:42.950 --> 04:47.910
One important note about my connection string by the way in app.js, there

04:47.960 --> 04:56.730
I'm connecting to a database and I will connect to my messages database, you can name this however you

04:56.730 --> 04:58.010
want.

04:58.020 --> 04:59.980
So now we'll connect to this database

05:00.030 --> 05:06.330
and thanks to this model, there mongoose will use a posts collection for us when we start using that

05:06.330 --> 05:07.160
model.

05:07.530 --> 05:12.120
Well speaking of that, let's start using that model in the next lecture.
