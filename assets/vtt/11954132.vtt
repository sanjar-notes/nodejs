In the last module, we had a closer look at NoSQL or especially mongodb and how you can use

00:09.290 --> 00:16.360
such a NoSQL database in our course mongodb, the most popular NoSQL database in a nodejs

00:16.370 --> 00:17.630
application.

00:17.690 --> 00:23.350
Hopefully you saw that it wasn't too difficult and still just as with SQL,

00:23.420 --> 00:30.890
we can abstract some complexity away from us and focus more on our data than the queries we write and

00:30.920 --> 00:38.090
here just as we had sequelize for SQL, we got mongoose for mongodb and mongoose is indeed pretty

00:38.090 --> 00:42.250
similar to sequelize in terms of what it tries to do,

00:42.320 --> 00:46.470
it tries to enable you to work with the data instead of with the queries.

00:46.550 --> 00:52.250
So what's in this module? We'll have a look at what mongoose is in detail and how we can add it to our

00:52.250 --> 00:55.760
project and how we can start using it and then we'll,

00:55.790 --> 00:56.900
well we will use it,

00:56.930 --> 00:59.520
we will use it in our nodejs application,

00:59.630 --> 01:05.390
I will give you a thorough introduction to mongoose, also show you where you can learn more about that

01:05.390 --> 01:07.040
if you want to dive deeper

01:07.220 --> 01:11.630
and we will transform our project once again to move from a

01:11.660 --> 01:18.440
we write all queries on our own approach to we just define how our data should look like and then

01:18.440 --> 01:20.080
work with it approach.

01:20.240 --> 01:21.530
So with that, let's dive in.
