So now we had a look at how we can use sessions and what the advantage of a session is

00:06.920 --> 00:12.110
and we also of course learned about cookies, what a cookie can be used for and how it plays together

00:12.110 --> 00:19.670
nicely with a session to identify a user, a client and then store the sensitive data on the server,

00:19.670 --> 00:26.810
so in the session and that difference between the sessions server side and cookies, client side is really important

00:26.900 --> 00:27.730
to understand and

00:27.740 --> 00:31.280
you also learned how to set a cookie and how to use a session.

00:31.430 --> 00:38.150
Now by the way if you're wondering how that session cookie, this cookie here, how this is set, well this is done

00:38.150 --> 00:40.100
automatically by express session

00:40.110 --> 00:42.040
so by that middleware we're configuring and

00:42.150 --> 00:49.010
that's also why you can add cookie related configurations here because this middleware automatically

00:49.160 --> 00:54.440
sets a cookie for you and it automatically reads the cookie value for you too,

00:54.530 --> 01:01.580
so it does all the cookie parsing and setting for you. Now with that, you actually rarely need to manage

01:01.580 --> 01:02.910
cookies on your own

01:02.930 --> 01:05.250
because that session cookie

01:05.270 --> 01:09.860
and with that I don't mean a cookie which gets lost after you close the browser but that cookie that

01:09.890 --> 01:17.150
identifies a server side session, that is the most prominent, the most common use case for cookies besides

01:17.240 --> 01:23.180
advertisement, tracking which you typically don't implement on your own but you use third party tools

01:23.290 --> 01:24.550
like Google for that.

01:24.740 --> 01:30.080
But that session cookie, so that session identifying cookie is an important thing

01:30.080 --> 01:33.710
and sessions on the server are often used for authentication

01:33.740 --> 01:37.580
but as I mentioned, you could use them for any kind of data you want to store.

01:37.580 --> 01:41.640
We happen to store the information whether the user is logged in

01:41.720 --> 01:48.020
but you could be storing the carts, the shopping cart of the user here or anything which belongs to a user

01:48.080 --> 01:51.140
which should be shared across requests as I highlighted.
