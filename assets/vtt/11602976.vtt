00:02.180 --> 00:09.260
With the last module, we took a major step forward because whilst still a lot of useful things like working

00:09.260 --> 00:14.960
with the database, authentication and so on are missing, we now have the general pattern set

00:14.960 --> 00:21.830
and you should have a general understanding of how a node and node express application works, how the

00:21.830 --> 00:29.670
flow is, how you connect your different pieces and which part of your code plays which role.

00:29.990 --> 00:31.630
So therefore this was a crucial part

00:31.640 --> 00:36.630
and now we're going to work a bit on the course project and therefore we'll practice what you learned.

00:36.710 --> 00:41.450
We'll add a couple of new views and we'll try to move this a bit further

00:41.450 --> 00:42.250
in the direction 

00:42.280 --> 00:45.450
of a more realistic online shop.

00:45.560 --> 00:50.810
Now one important note, this module is completely optional,

00:50.990 --> 00:57.770
you can of course skip it and simply download the finished code which we'll add to this module at the end

00:57.770 --> 01:01.480
of this module or in the first lecture of the next module.

01:01.730 --> 01:07.140
So if you're not interested in practicing this and adding all these new views and controllers and you

01:07.140 --> 01:10.550
simply want to learn the next concept, you can skip ahead,

01:10.550 --> 01:14.850
you can skip this module or fast forward through it

01:14.870 --> 01:15.470
otherwise

01:15.560 --> 01:18.910
let's dive in and let's continue working on our course project.
