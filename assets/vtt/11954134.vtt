So what is mongoose? Mongoose is an ODM, an object document mapping library

00:08.810 --> 00:15.580
and that's really similar to sequelize which was an ORM, an object relational mapping library

00:15.680 --> 00:20.320
and the difference of course just is that mongodb is not a relational database,

00:20.450 --> 00:22.310
it's a document database,

00:22.310 --> 00:26.130
it thinks in documents and hence we have an ODM here.

00:26.480 --> 00:31.840
So the idea stays the same though, we have some data, some entity in our application,

00:31.850 --> 00:38.570
let's say a user and we want to save that to a collection, we want to map our javascript object to a

00:38.570 --> 00:41.940
document in a collection that could look something like this

00:42.020 --> 00:45.200
and of course we can write the query for that on our own,

00:45.200 --> 00:52.130
that is exactly what we did in the last module but it would be a bit easier if we could just focus on

00:52.160 --> 00:57.590
our objects, on our data and see how it should look like and then work with it and this is not even

00:57.590 --> 00:59.450
the final syntax you see here,

00:59.450 --> 01:05.500
we can use mongoose a bit differently than you see it here but even that would be a bit more concise.

01:05.570 --> 01:07.040
So just as sequelize,

01:07.250 --> 01:13.010
mongoose tries to allow us to define models with which we then work and where all the queries are done

01:13.010 --> 01:18.180
behind the scenes which of course does not mean that we can't influence and that we can't change some

01:18.180 --> 01:19.160
things.

01:19.340 --> 01:25.400
The core concepts are that we work with schemas and models where we define how our data should look like

01:25.580 --> 01:29.450
and then we have so-called instances where we instantiate our models,

01:29.480 --> 01:34.800
so where we create real javascript objects we can work with that are based on our blueprints

01:35.270 --> 01:43.130
and once we get that setup, we can run queries and there we again use our objects, we use our models

01:43.370 --> 01:45.430
and we can then query the database

01:45.470 --> 01:52.000
but through mongoose with various helpers we get, some syntactical sugar and so on.

01:52.010 --> 01:57.680
So that's the idea behind mongoose, really similar to what sequelize did for SQL

01:57.800 --> 02:02.800
and therefore with that, let's dive in, let's add it to our project and let's see how we can use it there.
