00:02.240 --> 00:07.330
Our html pages look pretty boring and obviously this is no css course,

00:07.350 --> 00:12.330
I got one if you want to learn more about css though but that's just a little side note

00:12.540 --> 00:18.450
but this is no css course but still, it's important to understand how you can serve css in your

00:18.450 --> 00:19.500
node apps too

00:19.530 --> 00:24.510
because typically, you have css and also javascript code in your apps.

00:24.570 --> 00:26.580
Now let's start simple,

00:26.610 --> 00:34.080
I'm on the slash page here, so on shop.html and let's add some styling here with good old style tags

00:34.230 --> 00:37.740
in the head section and this is not the way we'll keep it,

00:37.740 --> 00:43.290
this is just so that we can work on it and auto-update this because importing an external style file

00:43.380 --> 00:46.390
wouldn't work at the moment to spoil the fun already.

00:46.440 --> 00:49.320
Now as before, you can skip this lecture

00:49.380 --> 00:54.070
if you don't want to write the style together with me and you'll find it attached to the next lecture,

00:54.270 --> 00:56.620
otherwise let's do this together.

00:56.760 --> 01:00.230
So let's start styling this and let's start with the header.

01:01.580 --> 01:04.070
Now I won't target the element directly instead

01:04.070 --> 01:08.010
this will be my main navigation or my main header,

01:08.020 --> 01:09.260
let's give it a class, main header

01:09.260 --> 01:10.010
header,

01:10.260 --> 01:17.180
this will be the main header nav and if you're wondering about the strange css class name, I'm using

01:17.180 --> 01:19.450
a styling system named bem,

01:19.460 --> 01:24.760
more on that can be learned in that css course I mentioned or of course you can google css bem,

01:24.950 --> 01:28.520
it's a certain way of naming your classes to avoid double class names

01:28.520 --> 01:42.100
basically, here I'll have my main header, whoops, header item list and here I'll have my main header

01:42.610 --> 01:46.620
items like this and you can of course name this however you want.

01:46.630 --> 01:50.110
So these are a bunch of css classes that should help us with styling,

01:50.150 --> 01:52.030
now let's start with the header.

01:52.030 --> 01:57.880
The header should have a width of 100% to take the full width of the page and let's say it should

01:57.880 --> 02:01.680
have a height of 56 pixels

02:01.840 --> 02:10.310
or if you want to work in rem which has certain advantages, we could also go with 3.5rem.

02:10.330 --> 02:17.200
Now let's also give it a nice background color and here you're really free, I'll not stick to red but now

02:17.200 --> 02:21.980
I can hover over this and use this nice color picker and pick any color you want,

02:21.980 --> 02:29.530
now I'll try to pick a nice yellow golden-ish orange color, something like this

02:29.530 --> 02:33.210
maybe, if you click on rgb it will also convert this to a hex code

02:33.220 --> 02:39.880
so let's use that and of course the class is not header but main header. And now if I save this and go

02:39.880 --> 02:41.500
back and reload,

02:41.530 --> 02:43.800
we got that, looks better. Now

02:43.810 --> 02:46.980
there is some padding in the body so

02:46.990 --> 02:52.210
let's actually define that we want to have no padding and no margin,

02:52.240 --> 02:59.230
I think it's a margin, that we don't want to have that, let's add this, looks almost better.

02:59.230 --> 03:01.180
We still got some margin here at the top,

03:01.180 --> 03:07.220
this is coming from our list in here though, that some margin call isn't doing its job here,

03:07.360 --> 03:11.870
now let's also get rid of that. By now

03:11.870 --> 03:14.590
also styling our main header

03:14.640 --> 03:15.320
item list.

03:15.360 --> 03:16.770
So let's copy that,

03:16.770 --> 03:18.230
add a class here,

03:18.450 --> 03:24.690
set the list style to none and remove any margin and padding

03:24.690 --> 03:27.990
we might have here, that looks better. Now

03:28.050 --> 03:32.000
obviously the items are not looking nice,

03:32.340 --> 03:39.150
for this I will actually change the display here to flex to use flexbox for the list and then style

03:39.180 --> 03:43.580
our items here a bit, on these items

03:43.620 --> 03:48.780
for now I'll remove all margin and padding they might have, reload.

03:48.780 --> 03:51.960
Now thanks to flexbox they're sitting next to each other,

03:51.960 --> 03:54.640
now let's also style our links in there.

03:54.840 --> 03:56.420
So main header item,

03:56.460 --> 04:06.190
any nested anchor tag should have no text decoration and a color of white maybe, looks a bit better.

04:06.250 --> 04:06.700
Now 

04:06.790 --> 04:09.020
vertical centering would also be nice

04:09.160 --> 04:16.600
and for that I'll go back to the main header, excuse me, back to the main header nav here, let's add a class

04:16.600 --> 04:17.720
for that too.

04:17.950 --> 04:23.290
And here I'll first of all use a height of 100% because this is a child element of the main

04:23.290 --> 04:28.840
header and therefore it should take all its height and this will also be display

04:29.010 --> 04:35.020
flex now and we can center items vertically with align items centered now.

04:36.170 --> 04:39.950
With this if I save that and reload this page,

04:39.950 --> 04:41.250
now this is centered,

04:41.300 --> 04:45.180
now let's add some padding to our main header.

04:45.400 --> 04:48.560
For this let's go here, add a padding, top and bottom

04:48.560 --> 04:54.910
I don't need padding but left and right maybe 1.5rem, something like this,

04:55.130 --> 04:58.440
on mobile phone also still ok I'd say.

04:58.670 --> 05:01.110
Let's also change the global font by the way

05:01.160 --> 05:02.100
so in the body

05:02.120 --> 05:03.200
I'll set the

05:03.440 --> 05:06.430
font family to sans-serif for now,

05:06.740 --> 05:09.560
looks a bit nicer than the serif font I think

05:09.830 --> 05:15.050
and now I want to have some space in-between my navigation items there so

05:15.140 --> 05:24.790
let's actually go to the main header item and let's add a margin to the left and right of 1rem, like

05:24.790 --> 05:25.400
that

05:25.750 --> 05:27.430
and for now, this will do.

05:27.430 --> 05:29.560
Now little hovering effect for the links maybe,

05:29.590 --> 05:39.870
so let's also go here, main header item hover and main header item active and let's also define a

05:39.870 --> 05:45.610
rule which would apply if the anchor has an active class attached to it

05:46.080 --> 05:48.890
and there I want to set the color

05:48.920 --> 05:59.070
to well we have this nice little yellow touch here, so we could go into the blue-ish direction here,

05:59.330 --> 06:01.700
maybe like this purple-ish color,

06:01.810 --> 06:05.110
let's let's see how that looks like.

06:05.250 --> 06:06.100
Not too shabby,

06:06.150 --> 06:07.430
so let's go with that

06:07.560 --> 06:14.580
and now since we have that active class rule here on shop.html where this link is active, we can actually

06:14.580 --> 06:19.650
add the active class here and you will learn how to set that dynamically later in the course too of

06:19.650 --> 06:20.580
course.

06:20.580 --> 06:23.490
So now this is active, now for the main section

06:23.490 --> 06:25.410
let's also style this.

06:25.600 --> 06:34.620
Here I will define a general rule for main that I want to have a padding of let's say 1rem in all directions

06:36.030 --> 06:38.180
and now this is the style I want to go with.

06:38.190 --> 06:47.820
Now let's also of course work on the admin add product styling here and we can simply copy the entire

06:47.820 --> 06:49.670
style object from the shop.html

06:49.670 --> 06:55.790
file in the add-product.html file and this will already get us pretty far.

06:56.160 --> 07:03.030
Now one thing we should change in add product, we should of course add all these classes, so we can basically

07:03.030 --> 07:04.430
copy that header

07:04.770 --> 07:07.650
and later we will also learn how to reuse it across files

07:07.650 --> 07:10.370
by the way. So let's copy that header,

07:11.150 --> 07:16.280
by the way that auto-formatting I'm doing occasionally can be set up in the preferences by going to

07:16.280 --> 07:22.280
the keyboard shortcuts and searching for format document, this is the shortcut I am using here but that's

07:22.280 --> 07:23.750
just a side note.

07:23.840 --> 07:28.780
So here we now also have to change the active class,

07:28.780 --> 07:35.020
it's not on the shop link here but of course it should go onto the add product link and with that if

07:35.020 --> 07:37.840
I now reload this page, looks way better.

07:37.870 --> 07:39.820
Now let's work on the form here too

07:41.280 --> 07:50.500
and for this, I want to go to my form, give it a class of product form maybe, the name is up to you,

07:51.450 --> 07:57.500
add a little div with which I give a class of form control and in that div,

07:57.540 --> 08:07.270
I'll insert this input here and I'll also add a label for the title, put title as a label on it, give that

08:07.300 --> 08:14.950
input the ID title so that it matches the label for accessibility reasons simply

08:15.000 --> 08:18.130
and now let's style this too. For this

08:18.160 --> 08:21.120
I'll use my form control,

08:21.170 --> 08:31.820
so this class I added to this rounding div and here, I want to make sure that a label as well as an input

08:31.850 --> 08:38.270
which is nested in a form control uses a display of type block so that it takes the full available

08:38.270 --> 08:39.350
width

08:39.490 --> 08:41.720
and I also want to style the input then,

08:42.130 --> 08:47.510
so the input here should have a border of one pixel solid

08:47.510 --> 08:54.720
and then I will reuse that yellow color we used for the header. The font should be inherited so that

08:54.720 --> 08:57.350
it uses the default font family and so on

08:57.920 --> 09:03.920
and I'll give it a little border radius of like two pixels maybe, let's see how that looks like or the

09:03.920 --> 09:10.570
radius. If I now reload this, doesn't look too bad,

09:11.980 --> 09:14.350
let's now also work on the button. For this

09:14.350 --> 09:19.140
I will set up a generic button style here for now, 

09:19.330 --> 09:21.970
inherit the default font,

09:22.180 --> 09:26.600
give it a border of one pixel solid and this light gray

09:28.030 --> 09:32.710
a background of white maybe,

09:32.900 --> 09:41.390
let's maybe give it a black border here simply and a border radius of three pixels.

09:41.390 --> 09:43.120
Now let's see how that looks like,

09:45.010 --> 09:48.600
it's ok but let's reuse the yellow color here actually

09:48.600 --> 09:53.090
and let's also give the text that yellow color.

09:53.150 --> 09:59.120
Additionally I want to make sure that we assign the pointer cursor to get this hand cursor when hovering

09:59.180 --> 09:59.890
over it

10:01.990 --> 10:08.040
and last but not least, I want to have some spacing but with my form control div and the button.

10:08.170 --> 10:15.970
So on the form control itself, I'll add some margin to top and bottom of

10:15.980 --> 10:18.650
let's say 1rem and 0 left and right

10:20.510 --> 10:22.810
so that this looks like that

10:22.960 --> 10:27.370
and I think for the button, maybe you want to go with the purple color since that

10:27.370 --> 10:28.690
should be easier to read

10:29.810 --> 10:34.810
and let's also assign a hover and an active state for that button

10:35.990 --> 10:43.240
and when it is active, I just want to set the background color to purple and the text color to white

10:43.270 --> 10:43.620
then.

10:47.060 --> 10:48.300
So now it looks like this

10:48.490 --> 10:49.810
and this doesn't look too shabby,

10:49.810 --> 10:54.160
we can go with that I guess, we can always work on this and we will continue to work on this throughout the

10:54.160 --> 10:55.000
course

10:55.000 --> 10:56.530
but for now this is good.

10:56.890 --> 10:59.010
Let's now center the entire form

10:59.170 --> 11:04.190
and for that I assigned the product form class to the form.

11:04.330 --> 11:15.400
So here I want to give this a width of let's say 30rem, a max width of 100% or of 90%

11:15.410 --> 11:16.630
in case we're on a mobile

11:16.690 --> 11:21.510
view, give it a margin of auto, this will automatically center it horizontally

11:21.980 --> 11:25.470
and now just make sure that the input and so on take the available space so

11:25.490 --> 11:29.520
let's reduce this 20 actually, I think 30 is a bit too much

11:29.630 --> 11:32.700
and on the form control for laying an input

11:32.720 --> 11:34.950
I'll give it a width of 100%.

11:36.560 --> 11:39.690
and now this looks much better.

11:39.870 --> 11:42.970
Now I'm not happy with the white text here now that I think about it

11:42.970 --> 11:50.580
so let's actually go to the header and change the white link text to black, let's see how that looks like,

11:52.350 --> 11:54.050
yeah I think I prefer that

11:54.050 --> 12:02.520
so let's actually take that and also add it to shop.html so that we have the black color there too

12:04.090 --> 12:06.960
and I think the purple could be a little bit darker.

12:07.090 --> 12:11.440
So let's now also go to the hovering and active style here

12:13.660 --> 12:20.530
and make this a darker purple and replace the purple in all occurrences with that color style.

12:20.530 --> 12:22.090
I'm using a multi-select feature of

12:22.090 --> 12:24.010
the IDE here to do that quickly,

12:24.110 --> 12:28.990
I can of course also search and replace to do that, reload,

12:29.260 --> 12:31.960
yeah I think that is a bit better.

12:32.020 --> 12:33.490
Now you can always tweak this to your needs,

12:33.490 --> 12:35.070
it's not a css course here.

12:35.170 --> 12:38.870
I just want to have some basic styling that we can use.

12:39.070 --> 12:44.280
So this is the style with which we'll go from now on and which we'll of course continue to tweak.

12:44.290 --> 12:51.790
Now one thing we should also do now, let's copy that style from the shop.html file and put it into

12:51.790 --> 12:54.120
the 404.html file here

12:55.550 --> 13:01.580
because there, I also want to take the header and copy that into there because I don't just want to have

13:01.580 --> 13:02.800
the page not found thing,

13:02.840 --> 13:11.210
I also want to show the header. So that now if I do enter some route which does not exist, like this, we

13:11.210 --> 13:12.340
also got the header there

13:12.380 --> 13:17.230
and we can at least leave that route, though we can't because I obviously got an error

13:17.250 --> 13:17.910
in the url,

13:17.930 --> 13:23.320
that should be admin flash add product.

13:23.490 --> 13:28.030
Now let's fix that everywhere here including our form of course,

13:30.550 --> 13:33.580
like that

13:33.690 --> 13:43.900
and now if I reload, we can navigate around just fine here and try adding a book, that seems to work.

13:44.000 --> 13:48.110
And with that, we get the styling in there, we get the basic html markup

13:48.230 --> 13:53.750
but of course regarding the styling, the issue is that it's all in our html files. It would be nice to have

13:53.750 --> 13:55.820
some external files for that, wouldn't it?
