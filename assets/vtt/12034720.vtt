Let's first of all start with the payment process, how does this work?

00:06.120 --> 00:08.020
Well it's a pretty long process,

00:08.130 --> 00:10.050
we start by collecting the payment method,

00:10.080 --> 00:15.170
so the credit card data typically. We then have to verify that, is the credit card data

00:15.180 --> 00:15.780
correct,

00:15.780 --> 00:16.920
is it expired,

00:16.950 --> 00:18.590
is the number correct?

00:18.630 --> 00:23.250
We then have to charge it and after we charge it, we have to manage payments,

00:23.250 --> 00:26.730
so that includes things like fraud protection,

00:26.730 --> 00:29.850
also managing disputes and so on.

00:29.880 --> 00:34.440
And last but not least, we of course have to process the order in our app, so in our server side code,

00:34.590 --> 00:36.880
for example that we store it in the database there.

00:37.200 --> 00:42.870
Now all the payment related things here are pretty complex tasks, both from a legal and a technical

00:42.870 --> 00:45.490
side and therefore typically you outsource them

00:45.540 --> 00:53.370
and by the way, even very big companies outsource this. Stripe is a very popular company offering payment

00:53.370 --> 00:54.090
services,

00:54.090 --> 01:00.180
it offers a great integration and it's super easy to add to any application as you will see in this module.

01:00.180 --> 01:01.240
How does it work?

01:01.470 --> 01:03.180
Well we have our client and our server,

01:03.210 --> 01:08.380
so that is all the code we own and we wrote and in the client, we'll collect credit card data.

01:08.400 --> 01:13.170
We'll do that with the help of stripe and we'll send it to the stripe servers which are not owned by

01:13.170 --> 01:20.040
us but by that company to validate that input. Once it is valid, stripe will return a token to us which

01:20.040 --> 01:26.120
basically encodes or which includes that credit card data and the confirmation that it is correct.

01:26.220 --> 01:28.380
We send that token to our server,

01:28.380 --> 01:36.810
so to our code and in our code, we create a charge or we charge this payment method then with the help

01:36.840 --> 01:37.950
of stripe again.

01:38.010 --> 01:44.880
So we create a payment, an object, a charge object, we send that to stripe with that token and with our price

01:44.900 --> 01:49.620
included and stripe will then do the actual charging, do the actual managing

01:49.650 --> 01:55.830
and we will get a response once this is done and then we can also continue with our code and edit this

01:55.830 --> 01:58.320
or store this in the database and so on.

01:58.320 --> 02:00.270
So this is generally how that will work,

02:00.270 --> 02:02.300
now let me walk you through that step by step.
