00:02.160 --> 00:07.620
So in this module, you learned about mongoose and I can only encourage you to dive into the official

00:07.620 --> 00:12.350
mongoose documentation to learn all about it and the many features it offers

00:12.540 --> 00:15.300
and I do really mean it as I said in the last lecture.

00:15.330 --> 00:17.240
Play around with our application,

00:17.340 --> 00:20.950
try adding sub-totals or totals to our orders here,

00:20.970 --> 00:25.410
play around, feel free to experiment with the data and with our application,

00:25.410 --> 00:26.880
this is what coding is all about

00:26.880 --> 00:32.850
in the end. The official docs for mongoose and mongodb or sequelize and SQL if you want to

00:32.850 --> 00:37.450
stick to that should give you everything you need to dive deeper and play around.

00:37.530 --> 00:42.270
At this point in the course though, you have a solid understanding of the different database solutions you

00:42.270 --> 00:44.360
could use, how you would use them, 

00:44.400 --> 00:50.880
why using tools like sequelize or mongoose might make a lot of sense and how you can integrate them

00:50.880 --> 00:52.540
into your application.

00:52.590 --> 00:54.500
Now what exactly you use,

00:54.570 --> 01:00.510
which database and which features of which package always depends on your exact application.

01:00.510 --> 01:06.180
I hope that these last modules gave you a great overview over the pool of options you could choose

01:06.180 --> 01:08.700
from and what you can do with them.

01:08.700 --> 01:12.300
We will continue with mongoose and mongodb in this course,

01:12.300 --> 01:17.160
however feel free to of course play around with SQL if you need that for your next project.

01:17.160 --> 01:18.630
But we will continue with that,

01:18.660 --> 01:24.450
we will therefore add some other features throughout the course, do a bit more with the database when we are able

01:24.450 --> 01:25.110
to do it

01:25.170 --> 01:31.710
like for example validate input and build our application whilst at the same time learning way more

01:31.710 --> 01:35.530
about node and express in general throughout the rest of this course.
