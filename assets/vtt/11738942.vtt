00:02.330 --> 00:07.070
So SQL or NoSQL, that is the question and to answer that question,

00:07.090 --> 00:13.810
we first of all have to understand the differences or what SQL and NoSQL databases are, how

00:13.810 --> 00:18.610
they differ, how they differ regarding how we store the data and so on.

00:18.630 --> 00:25.350
Our goal always is to store data and make it easily available or accessible so that we have an easy

00:25.350 --> 00:30.440
way of accessing our data and not just easy from a code perspective

00:30.510 --> 00:34.080
but of course efficient, it should be fast.

00:34.080 --> 00:35.740
That is why we use a database,

00:35.820 --> 00:40.710
it's simply quicker than accessing a file especially as the data in there grows,

00:40.710 --> 00:47.550
it also helps us with things like we don't have to read the entire file to just find one piece of information.

00:47.580 --> 00:51.950
Now as I mentioned, we can opt for a SQL-based database,

00:52.080 --> 00:59.500
MySQL would be an example database engine that you can use or a NoSQL database and there mongodb

00:59.500 --> 01:03.470
is one of the most prominent and well known alternatives.

01:03.960 --> 01:08.910
So what is SQL, how does it work then? SQL database

01:08.940 --> 01:11.300
thinks in so-called tables,

01:11.370 --> 01:18.600
so we might have a users, a product and let's say an orders table and in each table, you have so-called

01:18.600 --> 01:26.310
fields or columns, for example a user could be defined by having an ID, an email, a name and a product

01:26.310 --> 01:29.870
could have an ID, title, price and a description.

01:29.880 --> 01:35.330
Now we fill in data for these fields, so-called records,

01:35.340 --> 01:42.000
so basically the rows in our tables. For example here we got a couple of users with their data and we

01:42.000 --> 01:46.420
get a couple of products too. SQL based databases

01:46.440 --> 01:46.980
also have

01:46.980 --> 01:55.800
one important thing, they allow you to relate different tables, for example an order could simply be described

01:55.830 --> 01:58.930
as a connection of a user and a product right

01:59.070 --> 02:03.900
because a user might order a couple of different products and a product might be ordered by a couple

02:03.900 --> 02:05.220
of different users.

02:05.220 --> 02:10.570
So basically we have such relations in SQL based databases, here

02:10.620 --> 02:13.970
we can see one example relation.

02:13.970 --> 02:19.740
This is one of the core things about SQL and in general, the core SQL database characteristics

02:19.800 --> 02:26.560
are that we have a strong data schema so that for each table, we clearly define how the data in there

02:26.610 --> 02:27.840
should look like,

02:27.930 --> 02:29.590
so which fields do we have,

02:29.700 --> 02:32.700
which type of data does each field store,

02:32.760 --> 02:33.610
is it a number,

02:33.630 --> 02:35.580
is it string, is it a text,

02:35.580 --> 02:36.990
is it a boolean?

02:36.990 --> 02:43.500
So that we have this strongly or strictly defined schema and all data in the table has to fit the schema

02:43.530 --> 02:44.490
for this table,

02:44.490 --> 02:45.790
this is really important,

02:45.810 --> 02:53.820
so this schema, this definition of how the data has to look like is one core thing in a SQL database.

02:53.820 --> 02:59.550
We also have relations between our data, that is another core characteristic of SQL based database,

03:00.150 --> 03:06.780
we relate our different tables with basically three important kinds of relations, one to one, one to many

03:06.990 --> 03:08.000
or many to many,

03:08.040 --> 03:12.900
this simply means that we can have two tables where each record fits one other record,

03:12.980 --> 03:18.900
a record might fit multiple other records or multiple records in table A can fit multiple records in table

03:18.930 --> 03:23.190
B and you'll see this in practice and in the code in this module.

03:23.430 --> 03:24.880
So tables are connected,

03:24.960 --> 03:27.330
that's another important thing.

03:27.330 --> 03:32.060
Now SQL simply stands for structured query language,

03:32.190 --> 03:34.260
so queries are a crucial things,

03:34.260 --> 03:40.680
queries are simply commands we use to interact with the database. And in SQL, a query look something

03:40.680 --> 03:41.390
like this,

03:41.400 --> 03:43.170
of course there are different commands,

03:43.170 --> 03:49.900
this would be a command that selects all users, so all entries, all records in the users table where the

03:49.990 --> 03:52.550
age is greater than 28.

03:52.650 --> 03:54.890
So this is a so-called query,

03:55.050 --> 04:01.740
we've got a couple of keywords there which are making up that SQL language, so the structured query

04:01.740 --> 04:08.220
language simply has these keywords and then we insert some parameters or some data we connect with

04:08.220 --> 04:09.030
these keywords,

04:09.030 --> 04:12.280
this is how SQL works.

04:12.330 --> 04:14.550
Now let's have a look at NoSQL

04:14.550 --> 04:15.480
in the next lecture then.
