00:02.170 --> 00:03.610
So let's work on the navigation

00:03.610 --> 00:07.420
and for now let's simply add links to all important views.

00:07.540 --> 00:15.280
So we got our /shop route so to the starting page, I also want to have a products link going to

00:15.280 --> 00:21.330
let's say /products and this is a route which doesn't exist yet which we'll have to add.

00:21.490 --> 00:28.990
I want to set the active css class there if the path is /products and in our controller where

00:28.990 --> 00:34.930
we render this view, we of course have to make sure that we then provide this path property with the

00:34.930 --> 00:36.840
right value.

00:36.850 --> 00:42.220
Now this is one additional link, the product detail is something we don't need to add here because

00:42.230 --> 00:46.450
we'll go there by clicking on a product, not from the main navigation.

00:46.480 --> 00:49.120
The cart is something I want to have here though

00:49.330 --> 00:57.350
so I'll add another item here in the navigation, my cart which should be reachable by going to /cart

00:57.580 --> 00:59.740
and of course the path I check here

00:59.740 --> 01:01.520
that also is /cart

01:01.600 --> 01:07.600
but don't forget this path here doesn't have to match this path here but it's simply easier to remember

01:07.750 --> 01:10.230
if we keep that close together.

01:10.270 --> 01:14.740
Now for the admin area, I want to have that add product link still,

01:14.890 --> 01:20.110
I don't need an edit product link because that should be triggered by clicking on a product in the

01:20.170 --> 01:24.730
admin products list but obviously I need a link for that then,

01:24.850 --> 01:33.070
so besides add product, I want to have an admin products link here which simply goes to admin products and

01:33.070 --> 01:38.820
loads a list of all the products for the administrator with administrative options and therefore here

01:38.830 --> 01:42.610
the path is also admin products. So this is looking good

01:42.610 --> 01:49.360
and if we now reload this, we see a bunch of new items in our main navigation. Now in mobile view, this gets

01:49.870 --> 01:56.060
well a bit cut off, for now I will leave this and add it in-between sections and then also append

01:56.110 --> 01:59.130
the code of course to make this responsive,

01:59.140 --> 02:04.570
let's not focus on the css now though, let's focus on our node logic.

02:04.840 --> 02:06.650
So we got all these items added

02:06.730 --> 02:13.080
and of course cart and so on, these routes all don't work because we haven't registered these routes.

02:13.090 --> 02:15.270
Now this is a great practice for you,

02:15.460 --> 02:19.930
we got the links here so you know which parts I want to use,

02:19.930 --> 02:27.790
you can now go ahead and add these routes, add fitting controller functions or even new controllers

02:27.820 --> 02:34.570
if you want and make sure you render the appropriate views. And if you're really feeling fancy, you can

02:34.570 --> 02:40.610
even go into these views and render the navigation as well as some dummy content there.

02:40.630 --> 02:42.670
This is all stuff we did thus far,

02:42.670 --> 02:47.340
we'll do it together in the next lecture but definitely feel free to try this on your own first.
