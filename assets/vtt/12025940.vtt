00:02.330 --> 00:05.650
So now we added pagination to our application

00:05.780 --> 00:08.840
and of course you can now tweak this adjusted to your needs,

00:08.840 --> 00:15.980
change the items per page you want to display for example, if you switch that to two and you reload, you won't

00:15.980 --> 00:19.740
find items on page 4 but you will find items on page 1

00:20.210 --> 00:26.840
and now you got all that logic in place that should allow you to display the data you want to display

00:26.880 --> 00:29.220
and to not fetch all the data in one go.

00:29.420 --> 00:33.470
And it's important for you to understand that since find uses a cursor,

00:33.470 --> 00:37.700
it does only retrieve the items you need. Count documents does not retrieve all,

00:37.730 --> 00:43.130
it only counts them which is faster than retrieving them and skip and limit also manage

00:43.400 --> 00:49.010
or are managed by mongodb in a way that you only transfer the items over the wire which you

00:49.010 --> 00:49.630
really need,

00:49.670 --> 00:54.980
so this is not doing some server side filtering of the data, it really filters it on the database server

00:55.070 --> 00:56.050
already.

00:56.090 --> 01:00.230
So this is how you can add pagination to your node express application.
