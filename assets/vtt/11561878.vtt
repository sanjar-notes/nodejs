That's it for this refresher module.

00:04.750 --> 00:07.770
Obviously, this is no complete JavaScript module.

00:07.780 --> 00:12.130
There are way more features which it didn't touch on, and the reason for that is simple.

00:12.310 --> 00:17.180
I do require very basic JavaScript knowledge, at least if you got none.

00:17.200 --> 00:21.130
Check out the resources are linked in the second lecture of this module.

00:21.160 --> 00:26.950
These resources allow you to dive into JavaScript for free or with paid courses, whatever you want.

00:28.300 --> 00:36.610
And with that, plus this refresher about next gen JavaScript items or features as well, you are more

00:36.610 --> 00:43.330
than prepared to continue with the course and now understand the code we will write throughout the course.

00:43.960 --> 00:45.170
I hope this was helpful.

00:45.190 --> 00:49.450
Let's now dive into Node.js and write exciting applications.
