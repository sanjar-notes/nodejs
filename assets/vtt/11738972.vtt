00:02.590 --> 00:08.950
So right now, our get products page is a bit broken because there we still use fetch all in a way that

00:09.160 --> 00:14.810
well simply does not work, we don't have this callback approach anymore

00:14.830 --> 00:19.680
so we have to remove that and instead we still want to render our view here in the end

00:19.840 --> 00:25.200
but we can pretty much copy the code we have here on get index

00:25.440 --> 00:28.990
and of course you could also therefore refactor this to use a shared function.

00:29.550 --> 00:35.190
But there, I now also have my then block and catch block and I will simply replace the render function there

00:35.210 --> 00:41.620
to not render the index page but the products page and use the rows as products. By the way,

00:41.670 --> 00:43.710
you can of course get rid of that field data,

00:43.740 --> 00:46.450
you don't need to extract that because we're not using it,

00:46.560 --> 00:51.960
I just wanted to show you how you can extract the different elements of an array in the argument list

00:51.990 --> 00:53.090
already.

00:53.190 --> 00:56.910
With that if you save this, the products page will also work again.

00:57.240 --> 00:58.830
Now that's all nice,

00:59.040 --> 01:00.700
what about add product?

01:00.750 --> 01:02.400
Let's tackle that next.
