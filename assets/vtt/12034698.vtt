Thus far in this course, we always had a look at a particular kind of request and response.

00:07.740 --> 00:10.900
The request was always a request sent from our browser

00:10.920 --> 00:18.360
when we submitted a form or entered a url or clicked a link and the response always was either a redirect

00:18.450 --> 00:20.910
or a new html page.

00:20.950 --> 00:27.810
Now that can take you very far but sometimes you get some work, some requests that will only happen behind

00:27.810 --> 00:28.680
the scenes,

00:28.680 --> 00:34.770
that means you don't want to get back a new html page, you only want to exchange some data with

00:34.770 --> 00:40.110
the server for example and I will show you what I mean and how this works in this module.

00:40.110 --> 00:46.170
So we'll have a look at what asynchronous javascript requests are, why we would use them and how we will

00:46.170 --> 00:46.640
use them.
