00:02.170 --> 00:09.760
Before we move on to rest API features which is a whole new block or a whole new way of interacting

00:09.760 --> 00:15.980
with the client and of which we got to taste with our asynchronous javascript, before we do that,

00:16.090 --> 00:21.550
let's finish our online shop by adding some payment functionality because what would be a shop without

00:21.550 --> 00:27.870
being able to pay? Now for that in this module, we'll add a simple checkout page.

00:27.940 --> 00:29.830
We'll collect some payment data,

00:29.830 --> 00:37.480
so credit card data from our user and we'll finally do the purchase, charge that credit card or at least

00:37.480 --> 00:39.520
simulate the charge in this module

00:39.670 --> 00:43.900
and well of course then still store the order as we did it before.

00:44.290 --> 00:51.280
Now for that, I'll use a third party provider, stripe which is a great provider for integrating payment

00:51.340 --> 00:52.790
into your application

00:52.900 --> 00:56.130
and I will show you how to integrate it step by step.
