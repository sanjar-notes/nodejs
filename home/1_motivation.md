# 1. Motivation
The goal here is to implement what I have learn in backend web development [theory](https://github.com/sanjar-notes/web-dev-backend).
Nodejs is a runtime, not a framework.

This repository will contain knowledge about the differences of nodejs and the browser, and talk about various libraries framework available for the runtime.
