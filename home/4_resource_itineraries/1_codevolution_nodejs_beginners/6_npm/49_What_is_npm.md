# 49. What is npm?
Created Friday 3 February 2023 at 10:41 am

"npm" is:
1. A software registry - a website containing code written by various developer. It's a large public database of JavaScript code that developers from all over the world can use to share and borrow code. Anyone can publish a "code package" to the registry.
2. A package manager - a CLI tool that helps in installing, removing and working with JavaScript code packages (mostly from the registry).

- npm is the default package manager for Node.js, and is shipped with the Node installation.
- There are other JavaScript packages, viz pnpm, yarn.
- Historically, npm did go by the name NPM (node package manager). It has evolved since, and is simply package manager for JavaScript (hence the name npm in lowercase).

**Why learn about npm** - to consume and contribute 3rd party code. This is essential for developing any app in a practical time frame.
