# 52. Versioning
Created Friday 3 February 2023 at 11:44 am

npm versions use semantic versioning as notation.

In X.Y.Z
- X: major version, updated if the changes are not backwards compatible.
- Y: minor version, updated if the changes are backwards compatible.
- Z: patch version, updated when there's a patch, that's backwards compatible.

- Semantic versioning starts from 0.1.0 is the first version. Not 0.0.1 since there can't be a patch for "nothing".
- When the code becomes production ready, the version becomes 1.0.0.
