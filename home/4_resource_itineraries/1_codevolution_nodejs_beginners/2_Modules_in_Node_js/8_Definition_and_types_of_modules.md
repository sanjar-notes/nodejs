Created Monday 23 January 2023 at 07:32 pm

## What is a module
A module is an encapsulated and reusable chunk of code that has it's own context

In Node.js, each file is treated as a separate module.


## Types of modules
In total, there are 3 types of modules:
1. **Local** modules - modules that we create in our app. Aka 'user defined' or 'custom' modules.
2. **Built-in** modules - modules that Node.js ships with out of the box
3. **Third-party** modules - modules written by other developers that we can use in our app

In this section, we'll learn about modules in Node.js, and more specifically about 'local modules'.
