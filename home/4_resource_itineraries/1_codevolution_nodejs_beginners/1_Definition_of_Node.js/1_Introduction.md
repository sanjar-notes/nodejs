Note: Node.js is also known as Node


## Why learn Node.js
- **One language** - Node.js can be used to build end-to-end apps in JavaScript. End-to-end meaning both the frontend and backend of a web-app.
- **Popularity** - A number of major companies like LinkedIn, Netflix, PayPal all migrated (majorly) from other backend technologies to Node
- **Job market** - Full stack development is a highly sought after skill by many companies
- **Community** - Node.js has huge community support, including educational resources.


## Course structure
1. Learn terms and concepts needed to understand what is Node.js
2. Modules (user defined)
3. Built-in modules
4. Node.js internals
5. npm - Node package manager
6. Project - build a CLI tool with Node.js
7. Miscellaneous

This is **enough** to understand core Node.js - **the focus of this course**.

**Practically** speaking, one uses libraries and frameworks that run on top of Node.js - that's a different skill set. Example - Express.js for web servers, Sequelize for ORM etc. **This is not covered in this course**.


## Prerequisites
Just one - modern JavaScript, including ES2015+ features.
