Created Monday 23 January 2023 at 02:11 am

## Setup the dev environment
1. Install an editor
2. Install Node.js using official instructions. I already know about `nvm`, so done.


## Writing a Hello World program (REPL)
1. Open the terminal
2. Run the command `node`
3. Enter some JavaScript and press enter to execute the code.


## Writing a Hello World program (file)
1. Create a new folder.
2. Create a file ending with `.js`. The convention is to call the "main" file `index.js`.
3. Write some JavaScript in it.
4. To execute the code, run the command `node` followed by the filename. There are some other options here:
```bash
node myFile.js
node index.js   # example

# (optionally) can omit the extension if it's .js
node index

# (optionally) omit file name, runs index.js
node .
```
