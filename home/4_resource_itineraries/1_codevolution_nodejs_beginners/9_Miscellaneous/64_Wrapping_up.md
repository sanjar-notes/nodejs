\[insert here] what we learnt in each section.
Where to go from here:
- Learn Express.js, it's a popular framework to create servers.
- Learn Jest or Vitest for writing unit tests for JavaScript apps.
- Learn TypeScript - using it can reduce run time bugs and makes development easier (better auto-completion in code editors).

Vishwas will make videos on these topics after some time. I, will now start the Node.js videos.
