Created Tuesday 21 March 2023 at 12:43 am

Our goals for a database are:
1. Easy to use - for the developer
2. Performance

## Types of databases
There are many classifications possible. A simple one is based on if a database has SQL like language and "relational nature". 

The two types are:
- SQL - SQL like. Relational. Examples - MySQL, PostgreSQL
- NoSQL - not like SQL database. Examples - MongoDB, Neo4j


## SQL
SQL (Structured Query Language) is a language and specification for a database.

There are many implementations of SQL. These implementations (i.e. database softwares) are called "SQL database". More generally, any database that has "relational" characteristics is usually tagged as an "SQL database".

Fundamental philosophies of "SQL" databases":
1. The primary construct is the "table". A table contains rows (aka records).
2. Tables can have relations - one-one, one-to-many, many-to-many.
3. Table schemas are strictly enforced.
4. High level language is SQL like.
