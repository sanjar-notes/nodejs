## Purpose/intent
- Having learnt Node.js fundamentals (somewhat significantly), it's time to move on to making applications and learning about ecosystem (including libraries, frameworks , tools) etc.
- Learn about general implementation details of backend development through Node.js. This can be generalized to other languages and runtimes like Go, Java etc. *I will still learn all about Node.js specifics*.
