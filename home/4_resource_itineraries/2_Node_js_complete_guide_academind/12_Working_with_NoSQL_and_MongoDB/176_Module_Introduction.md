# 176. Module Introduction
Created Tuesday 2 May 2023 at 03:45 am

- SQL databases are popular and time tested. We studied a little bit about SQL databases (MySQL) and spent significant time exploring Sequelize (an ORM for SQL databases).
- NoSQL databases are also quite popular, but are more recent than SQL databases.
- MongoDB is the most popular NoSQL database. We'll have an introduction to this.
- We'll learn how to use the MongoDB Driver, which is a way to interact with MongoDB databases from a Node.js app.
