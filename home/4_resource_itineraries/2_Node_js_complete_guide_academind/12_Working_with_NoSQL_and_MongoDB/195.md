# Need to store associated models
Created Sunday 7 May 2023 at 10:01 am

Products are created by admin, who are a User too. So, we need to store the User, or a reference to it in a Product, so we access the user who created a product.

This should be thought through clearly, since storing whole objects may result in inconsistencies. Example - we saved the whole user object in each product, but after some time, the user changed their username, and therefore all user data in their products are now stale. This is a con, but it also has the advantage that a single call gets the product as well as the associated user data in *one call*.
**Alternatively**, if we just store the user's id in each product, we'd need an extra call (`User.findBy(prod.userId)`) if we wish to know user data associated with a product.

*In other words*, there's a trade-off between extra calls and degree of duplication.

In the current application, the product detail page does not need to show the admin info, so storing whole user object in every product is not needed, storing only the id would be fine.

Updated Product model
```js
class Product {
  constructor(/* existing params, */ userId) {
    // existing code
    
    this.userId = userId;
  }
}
```
