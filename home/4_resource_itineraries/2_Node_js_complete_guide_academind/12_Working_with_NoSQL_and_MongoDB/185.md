## Understanding the MongoDB Compass
MongoDB Compass is desktop GUI app that helps in exploring MongoDB databases. It's available for Win, Mac, Linux

Install it, and connect to cluster we created on the cloud. Do more config if needed.

*The MySQL workbench analogue for MongoDB*

We'll use Compass for learning MongoDB and debugging our app


## Fetching all products (for index page)
```js
class Product {
	// some code here
	
  static fetchAll() {
    const db = getDb();
    return db
      .collection('products')
      .find() // has generator behavior by default
      .toArray() // to avoid? generator behavior of `find`
      .then(products => {
        console.log(products);
        return products;
      })
      .catch(err => {
        console.log(err);
      });
  }
}
```


## Fetching a single product (187)
```js
class Product {
// some code here
  static findById(prodId) {
	const db = getDb();
	
	const prodId; /*  = some code here*/;
	const product = 
	await db.collection('products')
		.find({ _id: prodId }) // _id should be used
		.next(); // to avoid? generator behavior of `find`

	return product;
  }
}
```
This doesn't work, though. Let's explore why.

### `_id` object
This code doesn't work because `_id` stored inside a MongoDB document is not of type string, and therefore comparison (equal) won't work. 

`_id` is actually a special object, specified by MongoDB. It's not a native JS feature.

Why is the `_id` like this? Reasons:
1. It is easy to work with in BSON
2. Has the property of uniqueness
3. `_id` generated after (in time) has higher alphabetical rank than ones created before.
4. And more..

### Fixing the code
- MongoDB provides utility method to create `_id` objects.
```js
...find({ _id: prodId }) // doesn't work


const mongodb = require("mongodb");
...find({ _id: new mongodb.ObjectId(prodId)}); // works
```

Read is easy, `product._id` will work fine, where `product` is the fetched Product.
