## Better connection management
Currently, we will need to use util/database.js for every DB operation. This is not ideal, since we'll create a new connection for each op. Also, we won't be able to close the connection.

Let's change the database util to prevent this.
```js
const mongodb = require('mongodb');
const MongoClient = mongodb.MongoClient;

let _db;

const mongoConnect = callback => {
  MongoClient.connect(
    'mongodb+srv://maximilian:9u4biljMQc4jjqbe@cluster0-ntrwp.mongodb.net/shop?retryWrites=true'
  )
    .then(client => {
      console.log('Connected!');
      _db = client.db();
      callback();
    })
    .catch(err => {
      console.log(err);
      throw err;
    });
};

const getDb = () => {
  if (_db) {
    return _db;
  }
  throw 'No database found!';
};

exports.mongoConnect = mongoConnect;
exports.getDb = getDb;
```
This way we'll first try to use use the connection (`getDb`). If this throws an error, we'll create a connection (`mongoConnect`) and then use `getDb`.

This is a good pattern.


## Create on first interaction - philosophy of MongoDB
Sequelize, or SQL requires the database or table to be present before a CRUD op can be done. This is not the case with MongoDB. A create call in MongoDB will create all preceding layers automatically, if they don't exist.


## Creating the models
Since we don't have a SQL database now, the Sequelize models will not work. Let's create the Product model again (we'll use a class again, just like we did earlier when using files for storage):
```js
class Product {
	constructor(price, title, description, ...)
	{
		this.price = price;
		this.title = title;
		...
	}

	save() {
		// interact with MongoDB
	}
}
```


## Using the database connection/creating products (184)
```js
const getDb = require('./util/database.js').getDb;

class Product {
	// some code here

	async create() {
	// assume no stupid errors occur

	  const db = getDb();
	  const result =
	  await db.collection('products').insertOne(this);

	// result has an `_id` that was autoassigned by MongoDB
	// Not stored at the top level though, so result._id won't have it
	}
}
```

Note: We need to comment out code that won't work, of course - in controllers and routes.
