## Creating the models
Since we don't have a SQL database now, the Sequelize models will not work. Let's create the Product model again (we'll use a class again, just like we did earlier when using files for storage):
```js
class Product {
	constructor(price, title, description, ...)
	{
		this.price = price;
		this.title = title;
		...
	}

	save() {
		// interact with MongoDB
	}
}
```


## Using the database connection/creating products (184)
```js
const getDb = require('./util/database.js').getDb;

class Product {
	// some code here

	async create() {
	// assume no stupid errors occur

	  const db = getDb();
	  const result =
	  await db.collection('products').insertOne(this);

	// result has an `_id` that was autoassigned by MongoDB
	// Not stored at the top level though, so result._id won't have it
	}
}
```

Note: We need to comment out code that won't work, of course - in controllers and routes.
