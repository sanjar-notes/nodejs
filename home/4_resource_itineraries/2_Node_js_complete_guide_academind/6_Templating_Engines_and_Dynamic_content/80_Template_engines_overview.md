## Some popular templating engines
These differ in:
1. Syntax - DSL
2. Philosophy
3. Reuse-constructs
4. Layout, and styling constructs

Engines:
1. EJS - normal HTML for markup, DSL for JS code.
2. Pug (aka Jade) - uses a minimized version of HTML, hashtag-curly brace syntax for placeholders. Special constructs for control flow.
3. Handlebars - normal HTML for markup, double curly brace syntax for placeholder. Similar to EJS, but has less features and different philosophy.
