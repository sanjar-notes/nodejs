## Using Relations in Mongoose (219)
Created Sunday 14 May 2023 at 05:03 pm

We added the Product model, but one thing is missing from it. Every product is created by a User (seller). This is a 1-N relation.


## `ref` in Mongoose
1-N relations are modelled in Mongoose using the `ref` attribute. 
Code:
```js
const ObjectId = Schema.Types.ObjectId;

// Example: the Wearer model. Assume Cloth model exists.
cloth: { ref: 'Cloth' } // myWearer.cloth will of type object

cloth: { ref: 'Cloth', type: String } // myWearer.cloth's type is String
cloth: { ref: 'Cloth', type: ObjectId } // myWearer.cloth's type is ObjectId
```
- The syntax is simple, add the attribute and use the keyword with the name of the model (to be associated).
- By default, a `ref` attribute will *not* be eager loaded, i.e. accessing the attribute will simply return the `_id` of the associated model. 
- By default, `_id` will be of type `ObjectId`.  This can be changed by specifying the `type:String` along with the ref. Now the `_id` will be a string when accessed.

FIXME: check these 3 (no type, type String and type ObjectId) - which is which. The docs are outrageously useless


## Continuing with the Product model
Let's update the Product model:
```js
const mongoose = require('mongoose');
const Schema = mongoose.Schema;

const productSchema = new Schema({
  title: String,
  price: { type: Number, required: true },
  description: String,
  imageUrl: String,

  userId: { type: Schema.Types.ObjectId, required: true };
});
```
