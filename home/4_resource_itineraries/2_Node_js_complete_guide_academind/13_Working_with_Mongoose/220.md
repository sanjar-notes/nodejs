## How the 3 relations work in NoSQL
We'll be focusing on MongoDB with Mongoose here.

The 3 relations:
1. One-one: directly embed the whole document.
	- Syntax: `User: { Cart: {...} }`
	- Another way keep the related docs in different collections. 
	- <details><summary>Why this works</summary>Embedding is the simplest way to ensure isolation to a given entity. *Ignorable*: Another way, perhaps more memory efficient, is to store the id, but have the instance be stored in a different collection altogether</details>
1. One-many: use a `ref` inside the many side model. 
	- Syntax: `Proudct: { seller: { ref: 'User' }` 
	- <details><summary>Why this works</summary>Because an attribute can only have a one `ref`, and it doesn't have to be the same for different instances.</details>
3. Many-many: use an array of `ref`s. 
	- An alternative way is to have an explicit junction collection. This is the best practice.
	- <details><summary>Why this works</summary>Since both sides can have multiple connections, embedding (isolation) doesn't make sense - since they've got to be independent. Array because we need to have multiple connections</details>
