## 213. Saving data through Mongoose
Created Sunday 7 May 2023 at 08:47 pm

The model code in our controllers will most remain the same. There are a few changes we'll need though:
```js
const Product = require('../models/Product');


const newProduct = new Product(title, price, description, imageUrl);
// will change to
const newProduct = new Product({ title, price, description, imageUrl});


// save remains unchanged, since Mongoose adds a .save for instances
newProduct
	.save()
	.then()
	.catch(); 
```
The `.save()` instance method will create a new collection (if it doesn't exist) and add a product in it.

The collection is named 'products', even though we never specified it. This is because Mongoose, by default, names the collection as a pluralized lowercase of the model name (which we did specify). `Product` --> `products`


## 214. Fetching all products
Created Sunday 7 May 2023 at 09:08 pm

Use the Mongoose provided `find` method. Syntax:
```js
Product.find() // has array behavior by default, unlike pure MongoDB

Product.find().cursor().then(); // alternate: to have generator behavior
```

Let's update the controller:
```js
ShopController.getProducts = (req, res, next) => {
  const allProducts = await Product.find();

  render('./products-list-view', { products: allProducts });
};
```


## 215. Fetching a single product
Created Sunday 7 May 2023 at 09:08 pm
Use the Mongoose provided `findById` method. Syntax:
```js
const product = await Product.findById(prodId);

// a major advantage here is that prodId can be a string, so we don't need to send a mongodb.ObjectId instance
```

Updating the controller:
```js
ShopController.getProducts = async (req, res, next) => {
  const prodId = req.params.productId;
  const product = await Product.findById(prodId);

  render('./product-detail-view', { product });
};
```
