## 213. Saving data through Mongoose
Created Sunday 7 May 2023 at 08:47 pm

The model code in our controllers will most remain the same. There are a few changes we'll need though:
```js
const Product = require('../models/Product');


const newProduct = new Product(title, price, description, imageUrl);
// will change to
const newProduct = new Product({ title, price, description, imageUrl});


// save remains unchanged, since Mongoose adds a .save for instances
newProduct
	.save()
	.then()
	.catch(); 
```
This will create a new collection and add a product in it.

The collection is named 'products', even though we never specified it. This is because Mongoose, by default, names the collection as a pluralized lowercase of the model name (which we did specify). `Product` --> `products`
