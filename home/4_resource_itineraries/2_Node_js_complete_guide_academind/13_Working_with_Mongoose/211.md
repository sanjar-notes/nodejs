## 211. Connecting to the MongoDB Server with Mongoose
Created Sunday 7 May 2023 at 08:25 pm

Mongoose docs  - https://mongoosejs.com/docs/

Install Mongoose by running `npm install mongoose`. It's a core dependency of course.

Mongoose manages one connection for us. Our code will change like this:
```js
const mongoose = require('mongoose');

// express code

mongoose
	.connect('SRV_link_with_username_and_password')
	.then(() => app.listen(3000))
	.catch(console.log);
```
At all places of use, we can use `mongoose` directly (by importing the package), there's no need for a util/database.js file. We can delete that file.
