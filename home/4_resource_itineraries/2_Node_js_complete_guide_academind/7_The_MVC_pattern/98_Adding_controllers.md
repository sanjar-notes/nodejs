Created Sunday 12 March 2023 at 07:36 pm

/not-exhaustive - coz wasting time on getting to a definition for controllers, right now is a waste of time

## What controllers to make
Controllers can be grouped in many ways, choose what's easy and scalable. Example:
1. One controller per route.
2. One controller per model action
Note: controllers are named as plural, e.g. "products". Models are named singular, e.g. just "product".
