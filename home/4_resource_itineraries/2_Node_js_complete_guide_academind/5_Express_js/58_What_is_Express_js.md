# 58. What is Express.js?
Created Sunday 19 February 2023 at 05:50 pm

## Situation
Writing server-side code, even if the business logic is ignored, is quite cumbersome and difficult if done using vanilla Node.js way.

We wish to focus on the business logic, i.e. the parts that make our app unique and special, and not on the nitty gritty details needed by any app.


## Frameworks
A framework is a system that provides many things:
1. Code - helper functions, classes, modules. This code usually has in-built protection against common security vulnerabilities.
2. Tools - to scaffold, develop, run, build executables/optimized files.
3. Rules - structure the app, ways to do common tasks, opinions for development.

Note: A library just provides the code part.


## Alternatives to Express.js
1. Vanilla Node.js - this may be suitable for a small app, or simple apps. It's good for learning.
2. Adonis.js - framework inspired by Laravel (a PHP based server side framework)
3. Koa
4. Sails.js
and many more.


## Why Express.js
Express.js is:
1. Popularity - the \*most popular and extensively used
2. Minimalistic - doesn't add too much functionality out of the box.
3. Extensibility - Express.js has an excellent plugin system, and there are lots of packages of common tasks that can be hooked into Express
