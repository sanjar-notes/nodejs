# 59. Installing Express.js
Created Sunday 19 February 2023 at 06:13 pm

- Install `express` package using `npm`.
- It's a production dependency, not a development one.

That's it.

## Basic express skeleton
[Code](https://github.com/exemplar-codes/express-app-academind/commit/8f03882bb2a11e19262536def7ac2dac93e254eb):
```js
const express = require('express');

const app = express();

... // app code

app.listen(3000, () => console.log('Server running on port 3000'));
```

Note: [Code - for random port, or getting the server's port](https://github.com/exemplar-codes/express-app-academind/commit/8f03882bb2a11e19262536def7ac2dac93e254eb)
