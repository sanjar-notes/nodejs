# 59. Installing Express.js
Created Sunday 19 February 2023 at 06:13 pm

- Install `express` package using `npm`.
- It's a production dependency, not a development one.

That's it.

## Basic express skeleton
- `express` returns a function on import.
- The app is created by calling the imported function.
- This "app" is a valid middleware itself (this fact is not used directly, but is important to understand).
- The "app" is also a valid callback for `http.Server.listen`. We, however, don't need to use this fact since express already has that function available on "app". Otherwise, we'd have to import an extra thing(`node:http`) that's used just once.
```js
const express = require('express');

const app = express();

... // app code

app.listen(3000, () => console.log('Server running on port 3000'));
```
