Created Monday 13 February 2023 at 10:50 am

## What is Node.js
- Node.js is a general purpose JavaScript runtime environment, unlike JavaScript in the browser (which is a sand-boxed environment).


## Alternatives to Node.js
- Python - Flask, Django
- C# - ASP.NET framework
- Java - Sprint framework
- Ruby - Ruby on Rails, Sinatra
- Go - Gin
- Rust - Actix
- PHP - Laravel
- JavaScript - Deno, bun


## Why learn Node.js
- Node.js's USP is that a single language (JavaScript) can be used to create both client side and server side apps. Simply said, DX.
- From a market perspective:
	- Node.js is acceptably performant
	- Lots of 3rd party packages, libraries, frameworks and tools are available
	- A large job market - since companies don't need to hire a specific dev just for the backend
