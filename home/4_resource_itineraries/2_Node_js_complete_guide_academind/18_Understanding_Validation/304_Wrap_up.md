## Wrap up: Validation in Express
Created Tuesday 22 August 2023

`express-validator` is a popular package used for validation and sanitization in the Express app dev ecosystem
It's:
1. Easy to use
2. Has very simple documentation
3. Is simple to extend

But there are more solutions to validation in express apps, explore them.

I'm not updating the code - since it'll take too long. Branch: https://github.com/exemplar-codes/online-shop-nodejs-branches/tree/18_data_validation ("18_data_validation")
