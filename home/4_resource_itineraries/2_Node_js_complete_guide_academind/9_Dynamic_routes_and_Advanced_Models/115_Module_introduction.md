# 115. Module introduction
Created Sunday 19 March 2023 at 08:28 pm

1. We need the ability to pass some data through request URLs.
	- We'll learn about dynamic routes (aka route params), query params. They are supported by Express out-of-the-box.
	- We'll also learn when to NOT use dynamic routes, query params and use a request body instead.
2. We'll enhance our models to support dynamic URLs.

Minor adjustments made to the project. [Code](https://github.com/exemplar-codes/online-shop-express-ejs-mvc/commit/60a704f94b6c63c7edb7b31bbf1495c1bd5bbe1a)
