1. We need the ability to pass some data through request URLs.
	- We'll learn about dynamic routes (aka route params), query params. They are supported by Express out-of-the-box.
	- We'll also learn when to NOT use dynamic routes, query params and use a request body instead.
2. We'll enhance our models to support dynamic URLs.
